INTRODUCTION
Overview
Health emergencies happen every day, everywhere. They affect adults and children and
include injuries and infections, heart attacks and strokes, acute complications of pregnancy
and of chronic disease. While specialised care may never be available at all times in all places,
a systematic approach to emergency conditions saves lives. The Disease Control Priorities
Project estimates that nearly half of deaths and a third of disabilities in low- and middle-income
countries result from conditions that could be addressed by emergency care.
The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM), has
developed the Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course for frontline providers who manage acute
life-threatening conditions with limited resources. These may include students, nurses, pre-
hospital technicians, clinical officers and doctors who are working in field (pre-hospital) or
hospital settings.
Emergency care providers must respond to ‘undifferentiated’ patients, those with acute
symptoms for which the cause may not be known. This course introduces a systematic approach
to managing acute, potentially life-threatening conditions even before a diagnosis is known.
BEC is based on the clinical recommendations of the WHO IMAI District Clinician Manual, WHO
Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children, WHO Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment
(ETAT) and WHO Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth. It includes modules on:
the ABCDE and SAMPLE history approach, trauma, difficulty in breathing, shock, and altered
mental status. The practical skills section covers the essential time-sensitive interventions for
these key acute presentations.
The WHO BEC package consists of:
 Participant workbook: the main reference source for participants, this interactive workbook
provides all the necessary course content, and includes an in-depth guide to essential skills,
a glossary of terms, review questions and case scenarios.
 Quick cards: these simple reference cards organize key assessment and management points
for use in clinical settings beyond the course. These are found at the end of each module
and together at the end of the workbook.
 Facilitator guide: this is an annotated version of the BEC workbook intended for facilitators.
Challenging concepts are highlighted, and notes on teaching strategy and lecture preparation
provided on each page. This volume also includes a Coordinator section with information on
course planning and logistics, and offers guidance for selecting and training facilitators.
 Presentation slide sets: these cover all course modules and are provided to support course
delivery.

INTRODUCTION
The BEC course may be implemented in many different ways to meet local needs, but a
recommended 5-day schedule is described in detail in the Coordinator section of the Facilitator
guide. The BEC content might also be spread across a few weeks as a module in undergraduate
nursing or medical curricula. The BEC package is designed to support the efforts of governments,
educational institutions, professional societies and others to train emergency care providers
acting within their designated scope of practice. WHO does not certify or accredit courses,
instructors or providers.
Scope of the course
Key acute presentations
These modules teach a practical and systematic approach to four acute and potentially life-
threatening presentations:
 Trauma
 Difficulty in breathing
 Shock
 Altered mental status
Most life-threatening conditions, whether the original cause was medical or surgical, infection
or injury, will present with one of these. In some cases the diagnosis may be known, while in
others, intervention may be required before a diagnosis can be made, perhaps because of
limited diagnostic resources, but often because of the acuity of the condition. These modules
introduce a systematic approach to assessment and management that can be used whether
or not a diagnosis has been made.
Frontline health-care providers will face many more presentations than are covered in this
course. This material is not meant to cover every acute condition, but to help providers address
time-sensitive conditions where early intervention has the potential to save lives. The course
is designed to lay a foundation for broader emergency assessment and management. Many
participants may already, or will later, be trained to provide care beyond what is described here.
Recommendations for handover to an “advanced provider” are meant to signal the need for
care beyond the scope of this course. In some cases, participants themselves may already be
trained to provide this additional care.
Other emergency presentations
There are other complaints that may represent a life-threatening condition requiring
emergency care even before it progresses to any of the key acute presentations listed above.
These include:
 chest discomfort;
 poisoning/ingestion/exposure;
 envenomation (bites/stings);
 any severe pain from an unclear source;
22

PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK
 contractions, pain or bleeding in late pregnancy.
These complaints may represent the early stage of a critical illness requiring rapid intervention
even when the person appears relatively well. The complete assessment and management of
these conditions is beyond the scope of this course, but they should always trigger transport
to, or consultation with, an advanced provider.
In addition, there are certain infectious exposures that require time-sensitive prophylaxis
(preventive treatment) whose effectiveness may be reduced by delays. These include:
 needle stick injury in a health care worker;
 unprotected sexual encounter, including in the context of assault;
 exposure to the saliva of an animal with suspected rabies.
These exposures should be evaluated as soon as possible at a center capable of providing
timely prophylaxis.
Special considerations for fever
Fever is a very common complaint and may be a sign of a life-threatening condition, or simply a sign
of a mild condition that will resolve itself. Because fever does not reliably indicate an emergency
condition, it is not addressed in a separate module here, but is covered in each of the core modules.
When associated with abnormal ABCDE findings (see “Approach to the emergency patient” section),
or any of the acute presentations above (trauma, difficulty in breathing, shock, altered mental
status), fever can be an important clue to severe illness and should be taken very seriously. There
are many more causes of fever than can be covered in this basic course, but most causes of fever
requiring emergency treatment are associated with one of the four key acute presentations.
There is no single approach to fever that is right for all emergencies, but there are some general
principles that can help in the assessment and management of emergency patients.
• Always consider infection in a person with fever (e.g. malaria, meningitis, pneumonia).
• Never use the absence of fever to rule out infection. People with overwhelming infection or
immune system problems may not be able to produce a fever and may have a normal or low body
temperature.
• Fever with abnormal vital signs and/or any of the four key acute conditions listed above will likely
require early antibiotic (and/or anti-malarial) treatment.
• Always consider whether local screening protocols for infectious disease outbreaks (e.g. for
haemorrhagic fevers) require further action (e.g. special reporting or management) in a person
with fever.
Obstetric delivery and neonatal resuscitation
Management of obstetric delivery and neonatal resuscitation are critical topics covered else-
where in existing WHO materials and are not covered in this course. See the WHO Maternal,
Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health department website (http://www.who.int/maternal_
child_adolescent/documents/en/) for training materials on these topics.

INTRODUCTION
Expected participant background knowledge
This course assumes a basic knowledge in the following areas:
 Use of personal protective equipment
 Basic human anatomy
 Basic history taking
 Basic physical examination skills, including taking vital signs, chest auscultation and
abdominal assessment
 Use of a glucometer
 Set up of an intravenous (IV) infusion
 Safe intramuscular injection
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
The decision about whether or not CPR is appropriate for a specific patient depends on many
factors, including understanding of the cause of the condition, knowledge of available resources,
and awareness of relevant institutional protocols and practices. There are many situations where
it may be appropriate to initiate and then terminate CPR after a certain interval, and others
where it may not be appropriate to initiate CPR. While this course addresses several aspects of
resuscitation, it does not cover general CPR protocols, as they may vary greatly by setting. Course
facilitators should direct participants to the appropriate source for relevant CPR protocols.
Medication
The medications discussed in this course are widely available and appropriate for use by the
frontline providers for whom the course is designed. They can be used in pre-hospital or facility-
based settings and are important early treatments for emergency conditions. The included
medications provide a foundation for initial emergency care, but almost every condition
discussed in this workbook will require treatments beyond those listed. Many important
emergency treatments used by advanced providers are not included in this course.
Handover/transfer
This course is designed to help providers identify and provide initial management for acute,
life-threatening conditions. Most acutely ill patients will require care beyond this initial
stage. This may be ongoing care delivered by the same provider, but more often will require
handover to a more advanced provider or facility. This process of deciding the appropriate
disposition – or next step of care – for the acutely ill patient is a vital part of emergency care.
Choosing an appropriate disposition involves assessing severity; estimating how rapidly the
condition may progress; considering whether transfer for a specific intervention (e.g. surgery,
blood transfusion) is needed; and identifying any specific risks based on a suspected or known
diagnosis (e.g. risk of recurrent seizure/convulsion, or worsening airway blockage). The special
disposition considerations for each key acute presentation and its associated diagnoses are
covered in the modules.

Planning for handover/transfer requires communicating essential information with the
receiving facility, creating a transport plan, and ensuring availability of the necessary supplies
to protect providers and care for patients. These components will be covered in detail in
“Transfer and handover” in the Skills section.
Triage
Triage is the systematic process of classifying patients by acuity to ensure the best match
between available resources and user needs. Triage is an essential component of emergency
care during routine and surge conditions, and is a higher-level process applied to all patients,
allowing assessment of the individual patient in context. As such, it is not addressed in this
course, but is often taught at the same time. WHO and ICRC, in collaboration with Médecins
Sans Frontières (MSF) and the South African Triage Score (SATS) team, have developed
a set of integrated triage tools and an associated open-access training module. Contact
emergencycare@who.int to request these materials.
Approach to the emergency patient
The BEC course is intended for a wide range of frontline providers and offers a basic approach
for life-threatening presentations. Emergency conditions often require urgent intervention
long before a diagnosis is established, and a presentation-based approach is essential to
managing patients effectively. The modules in this course teach the elements of a general
approach that can be used for any emergency patient. Aaron
The ABCDE approach allows rapid assessment and intervention for life threats using the
following categories:
A: AIRWAY
B: BREATHING
C: CIRCULATION
D: DISABILITY
E: EXPOSURE
Essential ABCDE considerations are listed in the modules for each of the four key presentations.
The SAMPLE history is a method of rapidly gathering the history critical to the management of
the acutely ill patient. The SAMPLE history categories are:
S: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
A: ALLERGIES
M: MEDICATIONS
P: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
L: LAST ORAL INTAKE
E: EVENTS SURROUNDING ILLNESS
Essential SAMPLE questions are listed in the modules for each of the four key presentations.

INTRODUCTION
The secondary survey is a complete physical examination based on the specific condition. The
essential relevant components of the secondary survey are listed in the modules for each of
the four key presentations. Further details are covered in the Skills section.
How to use this Participant Workbook
This Participant Workbook is linked with the WHO BEC course presentations and is designed to
help participants prepare for each lesson to maximize learning. Each module provides reading
material and exercises to complete before the lesson. Participants should not worry if there
are elements they do not fully understand while reading alone, as all workbook content will
be reviewed during the lessons.
Before each lesson, participants should:
 write out the definitions for the Key terms of the relevant module by copying from the
Glossary in the back of the workbook;
 complete all workbook review questions in the relevant modules.
The multiple choice questions and case scenarios at the end of each module will be covered in
the small group sessions during the course, but participants should read through them before
the session.
On completion of the course, participants can use this book for reference. Accompanying the
book are reference quick cards. These cards provide a summary of the essential points from
the course and are designed to be carried in the clinical setting to guide day-to-day practice.
Module format
This course includes one module on the general approach to all emergency patients (ABCDE
and SAMPLE); one module on the approach to injured patients (trauma); three modules on
other specific clinical presentations (difficulty in breathing, shock, and altered mental status);
a skills section; and a Glossary.
The modules include the following sections:
Objectives: A list of things participants should be able to do by the end of the course.
Essential skills: A list of skills relevant to the module (and later taught in the Skills section).
Key terms: Important words and phrases needed to understand the module. All definitions can
be found in the Glossary and should be written in the space provided prior to the lecture.
Overview: A brief introduction to the clinical presentation being discussed in the module.
Goals of initial assessment: The main purpose of the assessment of the clinical presentation.
Goals of acute management: The desired result of the management of the clinical condition.
ABCDE key elements: ABCDE findings and interventions related to the specific clinical condition
addressed in the module.
Key history findings (ASK): Specific SAMPLE history elements related to the clinical presentation
that are critical for management.

Secondary survey findings (CHECK, including Look, Listen and Feel): Relevant secondary examination
findings to check for in the clinical presentation the module addresses.
Possible causes: Specific diseases, injuries, or illnesses that can cause the condition presented
in the module (along with their specific signs and symptoms).
Management (DO): These sections describe management of specific conditions. Note that the
ABCDE and Trauma modules have much longer lists of possible emergency conditions, and the
Possible causes and Management sections are presented in tables. The Trauma module has a
separate table for Primary Survey conditions.
Special considerations in children: Important differences in the signs and symptoms and
management needs of children.
Disposition considerations: Specific things to consider when transferring or handing over
patients.
Facilitator-led case scenarios: These scenarios test participants’ ability to use what they have
learned to manage a patient. These scenarios will be led by the instructor.
Multiple choice questions (MCQ): There are five multiple choice questions to test your knowledge
at the end of each module in preparation for the final written exam.
Participant requirements
Participants should confirm course requirements with their facilitator. When implemented in
full, the Basic Emergency Care course requires completion of ALL components listed below.
Pre-test. Before receiving the Basic Emergency Care course workbook, participants should
have completed this brief confidential test, which helps facilitators understand their current
knowledge level.
Attendance report. Participants must sign in for both the morning and afternoon sessions each
day. Participants must attend all sessions to pass the course.
Workbook completion. As described above, participants should complete all key terms
and workbook questions in the relevant module prior to each lesson. All key terms must be
defined, and all workbook questions answered for the workbook to be considered completed.
The workbooks will be reviewed each day by facilitators. Participants must complete the
workbook to pass the course.
Skill stations. During the skills day, facilitators will demonstrate skills at a practical station.
Participants will have an opportunity to practise the skill at each station several times.
Participants may practise a skill as many times as needed within the allotted station time. During
practice, participants may use the workbook and skill checklist for reference, and may ask
questions as needed of facilitators. During assessment, no reference materials will be allowed,
so participants should also practise without references, and have another participant observe
for any missed steps. Participants will have plenty of time to practise and feel confident with
the skills prior to assessment, and when ready, should request that an instructor assess them
performing the skill. All steps in the skill checklist must be performed to pass the assessment.
Participants must pass the skill station assessments to pass the course.
77

INTRODUCTION
Case scenarios. All participants must successfully lead and manage a case scenario to
pass the course. These scenarios give participants an opportunity to practise an integrated
approach to management in small groups of 3–4 participants. Facilitators will discuss with the
group how to approach the case scenarios using the ABCDE approach. In the later modules,
each participant will be assessed on the ability to lead and manage a case scenario. Leading a
case scenario includes identifying critical aspects of assessment and management, as well as
presenting a handover summary (see the Handover section in Skills). Facilitators will complete
the checklist below to assess the participant leading the case. Participants who are unsuccessful
in identifying and managing the critical conditions in the scenario will be given a second case
in the same or a subsequent session. Assessments are based on a standardized guide and
reported on the form below.
Case scenario assessment Not Identified Identified

OVERVIEW
Approaching every patient in a systematic way ensures that life-threatening conditions are
recognized promptly and that the most critical interventions are done first. In a stable patient,
the initial ABCDE approach may only take seconds to a few minutes. The ABCDE should be
followed by a rapid history using the SAMPLE approach (Signs and Symptoms, Allergies,
Medications, Past medical history, Last oral intake and Events). The SAMPLE history categories
are described in general below, and essential questions for a specific presentation are listed in
the relevant module. Using the standard SAMPLE and ABCDE approach together ensures that
different providers can easily communicate about acutely ill patients.
The goal of the ABCDE approach is to rapidly identify life-threatening conditions;
ensure the airway stays open; and ensure that breathing and circulation are adequate
to deliver oxygen to the body.
The goal of the SAMPLE approach is to rapidly gather history critical to the management
of the acutely ill patient.
This module will address:
 Safety considerations
 Elements of the ABCDE approach
 In-depth: acute life-threatening conditions (signs, symptoms and management)
 Paediatric considerations in the ABCDE approach
 Elements of the SAMPLE history
 Disposition considerations
SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
A critical part of the approach to any ill or injured patient is keeping providers and others safe.
An ill or injured provider will be unable to help anyone, and instead becomes an extra patient
for other responders to treat. Safety consideration involves checking for:
 scene hazards. Is there a fire, electrical wire or chemical spill that could injure providers or
bystanders? At a road traffic crash, is the scene closed to oncoming traffic? If a building has
collapsed, is it safe to enter? At the scene of an explosion, always consider the possibility of
further explosions. Remember that delayed building collapse may follow explosions, fires
and earthquakes.
 violence. Is there a chance that providers may be harmed by the patient or by others? For
patients who are aggressive or agitated, request help as needed from security personnel or
police before beginning your assessment.
 infectious disease risk. Is there a possibility for disease exposure (such as flu or haemorrhagic
fever)?
1155

--- Page 24 ---
Module 1: The ABCDE and SAMPLE history approach
USE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
You may not know the cause of illness or injury when you first approach a patient, and without
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), may expose yourself to diseases, chemicals
or poisons. You must use appropriate PPE every time you approach a patient. Always protect
yourself from any exposure to bodily fluids. This will almost always require gloves and eye
protection, and may require a gown and mask. Some circumstances, such as suspected or
confirmed haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, require specific protective practices. Always be sure
that you are up-to-date on current local recommendations.
CLEANING AND DECONTAMINATION
Infectious disease exposure is a significant risk. Use PPE and wash your hands before and after
every patient contact. At the scene, hand washing may not be immediately possible; carry an
alcohol gel cleanser if possible. Between patients, clean and disinfect all facility and vehicle
surfaces and all reusable equipment.
Decontamination may be required after exposure to pesticides or other chemicals (dry or wet)
and, depending on the chemical, may include washing or brushing to remove the substance.
Not all chemicals can be safely washed away, and some must be removed in specific ways to
avoid further injury. You must wear appropriate PPE for this. Refer to local decontamination
protocols for people and equipment.
ASK FOR MORE HELP IF NEEDED
 If multiple people are injured or ill, call for help or send someone to call.
 If advanced care is needed, begin making arrangements as early as possible for consultations
or transfers.
 Know the relevant local agencies to contact for suspected outbreaks or hazardous
exposures, such as chemical spills or radiation. There is often support and guidance available
for containment and decontamination.

complaining of abdominal pain.

ELEMENTS OF THE ABCDE APPROACH
The ABCDE approach
The ABCDE approach provides a framework for the systematic and organized evaluation of
acutely ill patients in order to rapidly identify and intervene for life-threatening conditions:
A – Airway: check for and correct any obstruction to movement of air into the lungs
B – Breathing: ensure adequate movement of air into the lungs
C – Circulation: evaluate whether there is adequate perfusion to deliver oxygen to the tissues;
check for signs of life-threatening bleeding
D – Disability: assess and protect brain and spine functions
E – Exposure: identify all injuries and any environmental threats and avoid hypothermia
This stepwise approach is designed to ensure that life-threatening conditions can be
identified and treated early, in order of priority. If a problem is discovered in any of these
steps, it must be addressed immediately before moving on to the next step. The ABCDE
approach should be performed in the first 5 minutes and repeated whenever a patient’s
condition changes or worsens.

PAEDIATRIC ABCDE CONSIDERATIONS
While the ABCDE approach is used in both adults and children, there are some aspects of
assessing and managing children that are different from adults. The “Paediatric considerations”
sections throughout the workbook highlight these differences.
Paediatric considerations
Pediatric airway conditions
A
Excessive drooling, stridor, airway swelling and unwillingness to move the neck are all high-risk
signs in children. Look carefully in the airway for foreign bodies, burns or obstruction. Allow the
child to remain in a position of comfort. Position airway as needed below.
Compared to adults, children have: So you must do this:
Bigger tongues. • Place the child in the “sniffing” position (modified
head-tilt, chin-lift – like the slight upward and 2
forward tilt of the head when sniffing a flower). page
Shorter necks with airways that are softer and • Avoid over-extending or flexing the neck.

• Position head (using padding under shoulders
for very small children) to open airway if no

Module 1: The ABCDE and SAMPLE history approach
Pediatric breathing conditions
B
• Nasal flaring, head bobbing, grunting and chest indrawing OR retractions, are signs of
respiratory distress in children.
page 33
• CYANOSIS – a blue/grey discoloration around the lips, mouth or fingertips – is the result of a lack
of oxygen and is a danger sign.
• CHEST INDRAWING is a common presentation of paediatric accessory muscle use.
– Look at the lower chest wall (lower ribs). The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall
goes IN when the child breathes IN.
– In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when
the child breathes IN.
Chest indrawing

distress in a child. With severe spasm and narrowing of the airways, there may be limited air
movement and few breath sounds on exam. Give salbutamol and oxygen and re-assess frequently.
Chest indrawing
[See SKILLS]
• STRIDOR signals severe airway compromise, and there are many possible causes. Children
with stridor should be allowed to stay in a position of comfort and transferred immediately to
an advanced provider. Further treatment will often include nebulized adrenaline. If immediate
transfer is not possible, consider intramuscular adrenaline as per severe allergic reaction
treatment. [See SKILLS]
Pediatric circulation conditions
C
• MANAGEMENT OF POOR PERFUSION IN CHILDREN MAY CHANGE based on the cause and on the
condition of the child. [See SHOCK and SKILLS modules]
• LOW BLOOD PRESSURE IN A CHILD IS A SIGN OF SEVERE SHOCK. Children are able to maintain
normal blood pressure for longer than adults when in shock. Closely monitor other signs of poor
perfusion, such as decreased urine output and altered mental status.
• THE AMOUNT OF INTRAVENOUS FLUID GIVEN TO CHILDREN IS DIFFERENT FROM ADULTS. [See
SKILLS]
• IN MALNOURISHED CHILDREN, both the rate of fluid administration and the type of fluid are
different. [See SKILLS]
• SEVERE SIGNS: Sunken fontanelle, poor skin pinch [See SKILLS], lethargy, altered mental status.

Pediatric disability conditions
D
• LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE is a very common cause of altered mental status in sick children.
– If possible, check blood glucose in children with altered mental status.
– When it is not possible to check the blood glucose level, administer glucose.
• Always check for seizure/convulsions.
• It is sometimes difficult to determine if infants are acting normally. Always ask the person caring
for the child.
Pediatric exposure conditions
E
• INFANTS AND CHILDREN HAVE DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING TEMPERATURE and can very quickly
become hypothermic (low body temperature) or hyperthermic (high body temperature).
– Remove wet clothing and dry skin thoroughly. Place infants skin-to-skin when possible.
– For hypothermia, be sure to cover infants’ heads (but do not obstruct face).
– For hyperthermia, unbundle tightly wrapped infants.
PAEDIATRIC DANGER SIGNS IN ABCDE
In addition to performing a thorough ABCDE approach, all paediatric patients should be evaluated
for the presence of danger signs. Children with danger signs need URGENT attention and referral/
handover to a provider able to provide advanced paediatric care.
Paediatric danger signs include:
• Signs of airway obstruction (stridor or drooling/unable to swallow saliva)
• Increased breathing effort (fast breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, chest indrawing or retractions)
• Cyanosis (blue colour of the skin, especially at the lips and fingertips)
• Altered mental status (including lethargy or unusual sleepiness, confusion, disorientation)
• Moves only when stimulated or no movement at all (AVPU other than “A”)
• Not feeding well or cannot drink or breastfeed
• Vomiting everything
• Seizures/convulsions
• Low body temperature (hypothermia)

Elements of the SAMPLE history
The SAMPLE approach is a standard way of gathering the key history related to an illness
or injury. Sources of information include: the ill/injured person, family members, friends,
bystanders, or prior providers. SAMPLE stands for:
S: Signs and symptoms
The patient/family’s report of signs and symptoms is essential to assessment and management.
A: Allergies
It is important to be aware of medication allergies so that treatments do not cause harm.
Allergies may also suggest anaphylaxis as the cause of acute symptoms.
M: Medications
Obtain a full list of medications that the person currently takes and ask about recent medication
or dose changes. These may affect treatment decisions and are important to understanding
the person’s chronic conditions.
P: Past medical history
Knowing prior medical conditions may help in understanding the current illness and may
change management choices.

DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
 If you have to intervene in any of the ABCDE categories, immediately plan for handover/
transfer to a higher level of care.
 Once you have completed the ABCDE approach, take a SAMPLE history and complete a
physical examination based on the specific condition (secondary examination).
 A good handover summary [See SKILLS] to the next provider requires:
– brief identification of the patient;
– relevant elements of the SAMPLE history;
– physical examination findings;
– record of interventions given;
– plans for care needed next and other concerns you may have.

FOR REFERENCE: NORMAL VITAL SIGNS
NORMAL ADULT VITAL SIGNS
 Pulse rate: 60–100 beats per minute
 Respiratory rate: 10–20 breaths per minute
– A respiratory rate of less than eight breaths per minute is a danger sign and may require
intervention.
 Systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg
 If you cannot take a blood pressure reading, you can use the pulse to estimate systolic blood
pressure. Feeling for a pulse at the locations below can provide an estimate of systolic blood
pressure in an adult (although this method may not work well in the elderly):
• Carotid (neck) pulse ≥ 60 mmHg
• Femoral (groin) pulse ≥ 70 mmHg
• Radial (wrist) pulse ≥ 80 mmHg
NORMAL PAEDIATRIC VITAL SIGNS
page 35
Vital signs are age-dependent in children. Normal heart rate and respiratory rate are higher
in younger children, and normal blood pressures are lower. The brachial (middle of the upper
arm) artery should be used to check the pulse in infants and small children.

or use weight-estimation tools such as PAWPER, Mercy TAPE, or Broselow tape.
 Children are able to maintain normal blood pressure for longer than adults when they are
in shock. You must check closely for signs of poor perfusion.
 The amount of IV fluid appropriate for children is different from that for adults. [See SKILLS]

Module 2: Approach to trauma
Overview
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TRAUMA CARE
Early priorities for an injured person include managing airway and breathing emergencies,
controlling bleeding, treating shock and immobilizing the spine if needed.
The goal of INITIAL ASSESSMENT is to identify life-threatening injuries.
The goal of ACUTE MANAGEMENT is to ensure oxygenation and perfusion, to control
pain and to plan ongoing care.
This module will guide you through the:
 Approach to trauma
 ABCDE: Trauma primary survey
 DO: Important conditions to recognize and manage in the primary survey (signs, symptoms
and management)
 ASK: Key history findings (SAMPLE history)
 CHECK: Trauma secondary survey
 DO: Important conditions to recognize and manage based on the history and secondary
survey (Signs, symptoms and management)
 Special populations
– Trauma in pregnancy
– Special considerations in children
 Disposition considerations
APPROACH TO TRAUMA
Approach to the trauma patient consists of three phases:
 Trauma primary survey: The ABCDE approach for injured patients
 SAMPLE history: Signs and Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last oral
intake, and Events surrounding the injury
 Trauma secondary survey: A complete head-to-toe examination to look for injuries not
identified by the primary survey
During primary and secondary surveys, if life-threatening problems are identified, STOP
AND MANAGE them.

ABCDE: TRAUMA PRIMARY SURVEY
The ABCDE approach in injured patients is often also called the trauma primary survey. As
for all patients this should be conducted within the first 5 minutes and repeated whenever
the patient’s condition worsens. This trauma-specific ABCDE approach includes the initial
assessment and management for all immediately life-threatening injuries. Always suspect
head and spine injury in a trauma patient with altered mental status.

• If concern for open skull fracture, give IV
antibiotics as per local protocol.
• Always check glucose and administer as needed.
• Do not give food or drink by mouth.
• Plan for early handover/transfer to a facility with
specialist care.
REMEMBER… People who initially appear well may have hidden life-threatening injuries,
such as internal bleeding. It is very important to re-assess trauma patients frequently
using the primary survey. Once you find a primary survey problem and manage it, go
back and repeat the primary survey to identify any new problems and make sure that
the management worked. Ideally, the ABCDE approach should be rechecked every 15
minutes and with any change in condition.
Vital signs should be checked at the end of the primary survey
A full set of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation if available)
should be performed after the primary survey. Do not delay primary survey interventions for
vital signs.

ASK: KEY HISTORY FINDINGS FOR TRAUMA PATIENTS
Information about an injured person and the injury event can be critical to planning
management. Children, older adults and people with chronic disease have an increased risk of
complications from trauma. They may need to be watched for several hours even when they
appear well. Certain mechanisms are often associated with multiple injuries, some of which
may not be obvious right away. High-risk mechanisms include:
 pedestrian being hit by a vehicle;
 motorcycle crashes or any vehicle crash with unrestrained occupants;
 falls from heights greater than 3 metres (or in children, twice the child’s height);
 gunshot or stab wounds;
 and explosion or fire in an enclosed space.
Use the SAMPLE approach to obtain a history. Remember that you may be able to obtain
information from bystanders, family, police, fire service or other health-care workers.
If the history identifies a primary survey condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO
PRIMARY SURVEY to manage it.
S: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
 Is there a history of hoarse or raspy voice, or other voice changes?
Changes in voice in the setting of injury to the head, neck or with burns may suggest that
the airway is swelling and that it may obstruct.
 Is there any difficulty in breathing?
Problems with breathing may develop over time and might not be present in the initial
primary survey. Difficulty in breathing may suggest that the person has an injury to the
lungs, ribs, muscles, chest wall or spine.

 Is there reported bleeding?
It is usually quite difficult for patients to estimate the volume of blood loss, but it may be
helpful to know how long there has been bleeding, how many bandages have been soaked
and if the bleeding is getting lighter or heavier.
 Is there confusion or unusual sleepiness?
Confusion after injury may be a sign of head injury, lack of oxygen or shock (with decreased
blood flow to the brain). A head injury can cause bleeding or increased pressure on the
brain leading to confusion, lethargy (increased sleepiness) and coma.
 Is there pain? Where is the pain, what does it feel like and how severe is it?
Pain is a sign of underlying injury. Headache may suggest that the person has an injury to
the skull or the brain. Pain along the spine can suggest an injury that may progress to cause
damage to the spinal cord. Pain in the chest or abdomen may suggest damage to the heart,
lungs or other organs. Pain in the pelvis or hips may suggest a fracture in the pelvis which
can cause serious bleeding and shock. Pain may be the first sign of an internal injury in the
chest, abdomen or pelvis.
 Is there nausea or vomiting?
This may indicate an abdominal or head injury.
 Is there reported numbness or weakness?
This may indicate a spinal injury.
 Are there reported vision changes?
Direct trauma to the eye, fractures of bones around the eye, and head injuries can all cause
vision changes.
A: ALLERGIES
 Any allergies to medications?
M: MEDICATIONS
 Currently taking any medications?
Medications that affect blood clotting (e.g. aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel) can make
bleeding more difficult to control and increase the risk of delayed bleeding. Blood pressure
medications can make it hard to manage shock. Obtain a full list of medications if possible
or ask family members to bring in medications.
4499

--- Page 58 ---
Module 2: Approach to trauma
P: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
 Is the person pregnant?
Pregnancy causes some of the organs to be moved out of their usual position and causes
changes in the body that need to be considered when managing trauma. Always ask
women of childbearing age about the date of last menstrual period.
 Tetanus status?
A person who has not had a tetanus vaccination within the past 5 years and who has an
injury that damages the skin needs a tetanus vaccination.
 Are other conditions present that put the person at higher risk for serious injury?
RISK FACTORS FOR POOR OUTCOMES FROM INJURY:
– Age less than 5 years or greater than 55 years
– Heart or lung disease
– Diabetes
– Liver failure (cirrhosis)
– Severely overweight
– Pregnancy
– Immunosuppression (including HIV)
– Bleeding disorder or taking blood-thinning medications (medications that prevent
clotting)
L: LAST ORAL INTAKE
 When did the person last eat or drink?
E: EVENTS SURROUNDING INJURY
Certain mechanisms of injury are so high risk that patients should be observed closely, even if
they do not appear to be significantly injured.
 Was there a fall from 3 metres or more (or twice the height in children)?
Falls are a common cause of injury for both adults and children. A greater distance fallen
increases the chance of serious injury. Falls in adults are often associated with older age,
alcohol intoxication, or the failure of workplace equipment, including scaffolding and
ladders. Children often fall from trees, windows or balconies.
 Was a pedestrian or a cyclist hit by a vehicle?
Adults and children who are hit by a vehicle while walking or using non-motorized forms of
transport (such as bicycles) are always at high risk of serious injury. Young children may be
less able than adults to report events, even major events like being hit by a vehicle. Always
consider the possibility of unwitnessed trauma in young children. Children and adults
can sustain multiple injuries when hit by a vehicle – both from direct impact to the body,
especially the lower extremities, and from secondary impact if they are thrown against the
windscreen or road, which may cause injuries anywhere in the body, including to head, neck,
chest or limbs.

 In a motorcycle (or powered 3-wheeler) crash, was the rider thrown?
Motorcycles collisions often result in a rider being thrown. Ask if the motorcyclist was
wearing a helmet and how far away from the vehicle the rider was found. Common injury
sites include head (especially when no helmet was worn), spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis
(as the rider hits the handlebars), as well as limbs and skin (as the rider hits the road).
 Was there a road traffic crash at high speed? Was the person thrown from or trapped
inside a vehicle? Did any vehicle occupants die in this crash?
With higher-speed crashes, greater force is transmitted to vehicle occupants increasing
the risk of serious injury. Vehicle occupants may be injured by impact with the windscreen
or steering wheel, or by the forces that result from the sudden stopping of the vehicle. A
person thrown from a vehicle is at very high risk of serious injury. If a person was trapped
within a vehicle it is important to find out what part of the body was trapped (arm/leg, etc.)
and for how long. Consider crush injury in a person who has been trapped. A death at the
scene of a road traffic crash suggests that there was significant force exerted on the vehicle
and its passengers. All passengers involved in the crash, even if they appear unhurt, are at
high risk for serious injury.
 In a motor vehicle crash, was the patient wearing a seatbelt?
Some types of injuries are more common in patients who were not wearing a seat-belt
(being thrown from the vehicle, head strike on the windscreen, chest strike on the steering
column). However, in very high-speed crashes, seat belts can also cause certain types of
injuries (cervical spine injury, abdominal injury).
 Was a weapon used?
Any time there is a history of a stab or gunshot wound, there may be multiple wounds.
Always check the full body for wounds. After a bullet enters the body it may not follow a
direct path and can twist throughout the body. Many internal organs can be injured by a
single bullet. A stab wound creates a direct path (it is important to know the length of the
blade that was used). Remember that blunt injuries from objects such as sticks and bats can
cause damage to internal organs in addition to obvious injuries such as fractures, bruises
and lacerations.
 Was there a burn? If so, what type of burn was it?
Burns from fires (flame burns) are the most common. A history of flame burn in an enclosed
space can also suggest an inhalation or airway injury. Scald burns (due to hot liquids) are
common in children. Electrical injuries often come from high-voltage sources such as
overhead electrical wires coming in contact with the body. On the surface, these electrical
injuries may look small but they can cause extensive tissue and muscle damage. The
electrical current often crosses the body, taking the shortest path from the point of contact
with the skin to the ground, often leaving entry and exit burn marks. In the case of chemical
burns, information about the specific chemical may be needed to remove it properly.
 For burns, was first aid provided at the scene?
It is important to know if the burning process was stopped, and in the event of a chemical
exposure, if decontamination was performed. If the burn is less than 3 hours old and no first
aid was provided, the wound will need to be washed with clean water to stop the burning
process. If there is a history of chemical exposure, protect yourself from the chemical and
ensure that it is properly removed from the skin.
5511

--- Page 60 ---
Module 2: Approach to trauma
 Did the person sustain a crush injury? Is there severe pain or numbness? Is there dark
urine?
Crush injuries may damage skin, muscle, blood vessels and bone. Damaged muscle can
release a muscle by-product (called myoglobin) that can build up and damage the kidneys.
It is important to know how long a body part was crushed. Even a small crushed area can
cause the release of a dangerous amount of myoglobin (for example when a limb is caught
under falling debris for an extended time). If a person with a crush injury has dark urine, this
may be a sign of build-up of myoglobin in the kidneys. Tissue damage and swelling from
crush injury can also cause a build-up of pressure (particularly in limb-crush injuries) that
can limit blood flow to the muscles and nerves (compartment syndrome).
 Did the person sustain a blast injury?
Blast injuries (from explosions) can involve all systems of the body, especially the hollow
organs. Common blast injuries include damage to the lungs, intestines and ears. Patients
involved in explosions need to be checked carefully and repeatedly because these injuries
are easily missed. Blasts may also be associated with foreign bodies in the skin and eyes,
burns or chemical injury, and toxin or radiation exposure.

CHECK: TRAUMA SECONDARY SURVEY
Following the primary survey and SAMPLE history, the secondary survey is a detailed head-to-
toe examination designed to identify any additional injuries or issues requiring intervention.
The secondary survey gives the provider an organized way to assess the entire body for signs
of trauma that may not have been obvious on the primary survey. Remember that very painful
or frightening injuries may distract both patients and providers from recognising other injuries.
Always examine the entire body. If the secondary survey identifies a primary survey condition,
STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO THE PRIMARY SURVEY to manage it.

NOTES:
• Spinal trauma is not always obvious. Fractured spinal bones can injure the spinal cord, causing
paralysis. If the spinal cord injury is in the cervical spine, paralysis could involve the muscles that
control respiration and could lead to death. Examination findings should be carefully documented so
that future providers can evaluate if the patient’s condition has changed.
• Spinal injuries can also cause shock. This can occur when nerves that control the contraction of the
blood vessels in the body are damaged. When the walls of a blood vessel relax, the vessel dilates
and pressure drops, leading to poor perfusion and shock. Risk is higher if there is also blood loss,
so patients must be monitored closely. Always consider spinal injury in a patient with shock that
does not improve with treatment.
• Spine boards should only be used to move patients. Leaving patients on spine boards for long

SPECIAL POPULATIONS
TRAUMA IN PREGNANCY
Any female patient aged 10–50 years should have a pregnancy test. Pregnancy causes
many changes in physiology and there are added considerations for fetal well-being.
Even minor trauma may cause harm to the mother and fetus. Women suffering trauma
in the third trimester are at risk for placental abruption (where the placenta can separate
from the uterus wall, resulting in bleeding), uterine rupture, and premature labour.
Remember resuscitation of the mother resuscitates the fetus.
KEY ELEMENTS OF PATIENT HISTORY
 Gestational age (age of the fetus or number of weeks since last menstrual period).
 Any pregnancy complications.
PRIMARY SURVEY
 Airway: swelling in pregnancy can make airway obstruction more likely, so monitor
closely.
 Breathing: the diaphragm is pushed up by the pregnant uterus, leaving less lung
space for breathing.
 Circulation: check for vaginal bleeding; a pregnant uterus can also compress large
blood vessels, causing hypotension. Place on left side with cervical spine precautions.
[See SKILLS]
 Disability: always consider eclampsia if seizures/convulsions occur.
 Exposure: keep patient warm.
COMMON CONDITIONS CAUSED BY TRAUMA
 Preterm (early) labour with or without premature rupture of membranes (loss of the
fluid surrounding the baby).
 Placental abruption or uterine rupture: causing blood loss and shock.
 Seizures/convulsions.
SPECIAL MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
 Plan early for handover/transfer to a specialist unit with obstetric care.
 If the uterus can be felt at the level of the umbilicus (belly button), this generally
indicates that the patient is at least 20 weeks pregnant.
 If the woman is more than 20 weeks (5 months) pregnant, the pregnant uterus can
compress the inferior vena cava, the large vessel that brings blood back to her heart,
and can cause shock. When lying the pregnant patient flat, always place on the left
side (on a spine board if immobilization necessary). [See SKILLS]
 Trauma in late pregnancy may trigger early labour. Prepare for neonatal resuscitation
as well when trauma occurs in late pregnancy.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN
Children can appear well after an injury, and yet deteriorate quickly. They have different
injury patterns, and serious internal organ injuries may occur without overlying skull
or rib fractures (paediatric bones are more flexible). Common management problems
include over- or under-resuscitation, medication errors and failure to recognize
hypothermia and hypoglycaemia.
Below are special considerations for injured children. Refer also to the ABCDE module for
normal paediatric vital signs and additional details. page 2
AIRWAY
• When neck trauma or cervical spine injury is suspected, use jaw thrust to manually
open airway while maintaining cervical spine immobilization. Children have big heads
and large tongues that may easily obstruct their airways. Young children and infants
may require a pad under the shoulders to align the airway. [See SKILLS]
BREATHING
• If the child is not breathing adequately after opening the airway, assist breathing with
a bag-valve-mask, ideaNllye wuittrha olx ypgoesn.ition in infants
• Give a breath every 4 seconds (15 breaths per minute) for older children and a breath
every 3 seconds (20 breaths per minute) for infants. [See SKILLS]
6677

--- Page 76 ---
Module 2: Approach to trauma
page 35
CIRCULATION
• For ongoing blood loss or evidence of poor perfusion in children with normal
nutritional status (see also SKILLS):
– place IV;
– give IV fluids and re-assess.
[See SKILLS]
• For malnourished children,
fluids MUST be adjusted.
[See SKILLS]
• For severe burn injury, initial
bolus is with dextrose-
containing fluids. [See SKILLS]
• If significant haemorrhage,
arrange for blood transfusion
or rapid handover/transfer
to a centre capable of blood
transfusion. Location of brachial pulse in a child
Location of brachial pulse in a child
DISABILITY
• Monitor child’s level of consciousness with the AVPU scale (Alert, responsive to Verbal
stimuli, responsive to Painful stimuli, Unresponsive). AVPU is preferred to GCS in young
children.
• Assess for and manage seizures/convulsions.
• Assess for and manage hypoglycaemia.
EXPOSURE
• Expose the entire body but watch for hypothermia.
• Protect the child’s modesty at all times.
• Use log-roll to assess remainder of child’s back and head.
Estimate weight in children based on age
Weight in kilograms = [age in years + 4] × 2
or use weight-estimation tools such as PAWPER
tape, Mercy TAPE, or Broselow tape, etc.
GENERAL
Young children may be less able than adults to report events, even major events like
being hit by a vehicle. Always consider the possibility of unwitnessed trauma in young
children.

HEAD INJURIES
Head injuries are a common cause of death in children, and children frequently suffer
from acute brain swelling after a severe head injury. If a paediatric patient has signs of
traumatic brain injury, transport urgently to a facility with critical care and/or surgical
capacity.
CHEST INJURIES
Chest injuries can be life-threatening, and children require less force for more serious
internal injuries. The ribs are more flexible than in adults, and there may be extensive
chest injuries without rib fractures.
ABDOMINAL INJURIES
Children’s abdomens are relatively larger than adults, and the abdomen is a common site
of injury in children. Injuries to the spleen and liver are especially common. Abdominal
injuries should be considered in all paediatric trauma patients as they can be life-
threatening and can cause severe internal bleeding.
BURN INJURIES
Burns in children can be difficult to manage. They require careful fluid resuscitation,
close observation for airway swelling, and pain medications for dressing changes. In
children who are burned, plan for rapid handover/transfer to a burn unit.

Module 2: Approach to trauma
DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
Trauma patients can have complex injuries that may be hidden, and can worsen and die very
quickly. Always refer seriously injured patients to a higher level of care for specialized treatment.
The following high-risk conditions always require handover/transfer to a specialist unit for
ongoing care:
 Airway problem requiring intervention.
 Signs of shock:
– Tension pneumothorax: perform needle decompression prior to transfer (will need
urgent chest tube placement).
– Pericardial tamponade: ensure IV fluids started and continued on transfer.
 Altered mental status (drowsy, lethargic, confused or unconscious).
 Trauma in pregnancy: place on left side for transport (needs specialist obstetric care).
 Child with ABCDE problem, burn, or any head, chest or abdominal injury.
 Any serious burn injury: assess the burn depth and total burn surface area, commence fluid
resuscitation (transfer preferably to a specialist burns unit). [See SKILLS]
Other considerations for transfer:
 If a patient has required oxygen, arrange to continue it during transport and after handover.
 If an injured person is displaying signs of shock, ensure IV fluid started and continued during
transfer. Ensure any external bleeding is controlled and monitored during transport.

Overview
Difficulty in breathing (DIB) is a term used to describe a range of conditions from a feeling of
shortness of breath to abnormal breathing movements, or any increased effort required to
breathe. DIB can result from problems in the upper or lower airways, the lungs, the heart or
the muscles used for breathing; or from conditions that may cause faster breathing (such as
anaemia or chemical imbalance).
DIB can be caused by:
 upper or lower airway obstruction (blockage by an object; by spasm of the airways, such as
with asthma; by swelling due to allergy; infection or injury);
 fluid in the airspaces of the lung (such as from pneumonia or pulmonary oedema);
 air or fluid outside the lung causing lung collapse or compression (such as pneumothorax
or effusion);
 blood clots in the vessels supplying the lungs;
 any other cause of decreased oxygen carried in the blood (such as anaemia);
 conditions that increase respiratory rate such as toxic ingestion, chemical imbalance (for
example in diabetic ketoacidosis) or anxiety.
The goal of INITIAL ASSESSMENT is to identify reversible causes of difficulty in breathing,
and to recognize conditions that require urgent intervention or rapid transfer.
The goal of ACUTE MANAGEMENT is to ensure the airway stays open and breathing is
adequate to deliver oxygen to the organs.

ABCDE: KEY ELEMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH DIFFICULTY IN
BREATHING
For the patient with difficulty in breathing, the following are key elements that should be
considered in the ABCDE approach.
AIRWAY
A
A person with difficulty in breathing may have airway swelling caused by
a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or choking (obstruction from a
foreign body). Stridor suggests serious airway narrowing.
BREATHING
B
Hypotension with absent breath sounds on one side – especially with
distended (swollen or enlarged) neck veins or tracheal shift – may indicate
tension pneumothorax. Wheezing may indicate asthma or severe allergic
reaction.
CIRCULATION
C
Shock, heart attack, heart failure and severe infection can all present
with poor perfusion and difficulty in breathing. Poor perfusion sends
signals to the brain to increase the rate of breathing, which can feel and
look like difficulty in breathing. Check for signs of shock by checking capillary refill, heart rate
and blood pressure. Swelling in the legs or crackles in the lungs can indicate heart failure and
fluid overload as a cause of difficulty in breathing.

DISABILITY
D
Patients with decreased level of consciousness may not be able to protect
their airways. Drugs, infection or injury can directly affect the part of the
brain that controls breathing. Assess for paralyzing conditions affecting
the breathing muscles.
Check level of consciousness with the AVPU scale:
A: Alert
V: Responds to Voice
P: Responds to Pain
U: Unresponsive
EXPOSURE
E
Expose the patient fully to assess for abnormal chest wall movement and
any signs of trauma. Penetrating trauma to the back, chest, underarms or
abdomen may cause lung injury and is often missed.
ASK: KEY HISTORY FINDINGS FOR PATIENTS WITH
DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING
Use the SAMPLE approach to obtain a history from the patient and/or family.
If the history identifies an ABCDE condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE
to manage it.
S: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
 When did the symptoms start and was onset sudden? Do they come and go and how
long do they last? Have they changed over time and has there been a similar episode
previously?
Sudden difficulty in breathing can suggest airway obstruction such as by a foreign body;
swelling of the airway from allergic reaction or infection; trauma to the airway, lungs, heart
or chest wall; or inhalation of hot gases or smoke. Acute heart problems such as heart attack,
abnormal heart rhythm or valve problems can cause rapid onset DIB. A history of rapid or
deep breathing may suggest poisoning, high acid levels in the blood (infection or diabetic
ketoacidosis) or anxiety. DIB that starts slowly is more common with infection and chronic
conditions such as a gradual build-up of fluid around the lungs (as occurs in TB and heart
failure), fluid around the heart (from TB or kidney disease), lung cancer or diseases affecting
the function of the chest wall. Recurrent difficulty in breathing associated with wheeze may
suggest asthma or COPD.
 Did anything trigger the difficulty in breathing and what makes it better or worse?
A history of allergies may suggest that the airway is blocked by swelling due to a severe
allergic reaction. Inhaling smoke or hot gas (such as in fires) or some chemicals may cause
7799

--- Page 88 ---
Module 3: Approach to difficulty in breathing
DIB through upper airway injury and swelling. Exposure to some chemicals (such as certain
pesticides) can cause fluid to build up in the airways and can cause weakness in the muscles
involved in breathing. Difficulty in breathing that gets worse when the person lies flat can
be due to fluid in the lungs.
 Is there any tongue or lip swelling, or voice changes?
Swelling to the mouth, lips, tongue or upper throat, or a change in voice can suggest a
severe allergic reaction or other inflammation of the airway.
 Are there abnormal sounds with breathing?
High-pitched or ‘squeaking’ sounds when breathing IN may be stridor, which is caused by
narrowing of the upper airway and may suggest severe allergic reaction or other airway
obstruction. Wheezing – a high-pitched sound with breathing OUT – is caused by narrowing
or spasm of the lower airways in the lungs and can suggest asthma, COPD, heart failure or
allergic reactions. Gurgling sounds with breathing suggest that there is mucus, blood or
other fluid in the airway.
 Is there pain associated with the difficulty in breathing?
Difficulty in breathing with chest pain can suggest heart attack, pneumothorax, pneumonia
or trauma to the lungs, ribs or ribcage muscles. In particular, pain that is worse with deep
breaths (pleuritic pain) may suggest infection or blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism).
 Is there fever or cough?
Fever suggests infection. Lung infection and any severe infection may cause fluid in the
lungs. A cough may indicate fluid in the lungs from pneumonia or oedema. Cough and
wheezing may suggest asthma or COPD.
 Is there foot or leg swelling or recent pregnancy?
Difficulty in breathing with oedema of both feet or legs can suggest heart failure with fluid
back-up to the lungs and body. Difficulty in breathing with swelling and pain in one leg may
suggest a clot in a leg vein that has travelled to the lung (pulmonary embolism). Pregnancy
is a risk factor for both pulmonary embolism and heart failure.
A: ALLERGIES
 Any allergies to medications or other substances? Any recent insect bites or stings?
Severe allergic reactions may cause difficulty in breathing due to airway swelling. People
can have severe allergic reactions to almost anything, but food, plants, medications and
insect bites/stings are the most common.
M: MEDICATIONS
 Currently taking any medications?
Ask about new medications and changes in doses. New medications can cause allergies
with associated difficulty in breathing. Accidental overdose of some medications can stop
or slow breathing.

P: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
 Is there a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?
Asthma and COPD often cause episodes of difficulty in breathing. A history of prior
hospitalization or intubation for these conditions suggests a high-risk patient.
 Is there a history of heart disease or kidney disease?
People with a history of heart or kidney failure may have fluid in the lungs. Heart attack may
present with difficulty in breathing.
 Is there a history of tuberculosis (TB) or cancer?
Conditions such as tuberculosis and cancer can cause build up of fluid in the sac around the
heart (pericardial effusion) or build-up of fluid outside the lung (pleural effusion), both of
which can cause a feeling of difficulty in breathing.
 Is there a history of diabetes?
Diabetes can cause diabetic crisis (diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA). DKA causes fast breathing
that may be reported as difficulty in breathing.
 Is there a history of smoking?
Smoking increases the risk of asthma, COPD, lung cancer and heart attack.
 Is there a history of HIV?
HIV infection increases the risk of other infections.
L: LAST ORAL INTAKE
 When did the person last eat or drink?
A full stomach puts the patient at risk of vomiting and possible choking.
E: EVENTS SURROUNDING ILLNESS
 What was the person doing when the difficulty in breathing started?
Always consider choking if DIB started while eating or drinking. DIB with exercise might be
due to heart attack, especially when there is also chest pain.
 Was the patient found in or near water?
Always consider drowning (inhalation of water) in a person found in or near water. Even a
small amount of inhaled water can cause serious lung damage, which can worsen over time.
 Has there been exposure to pesticides or other chemicals?
Inhaled chemicals can cause DIB by irritating the airways and lungs. Some pesticides used in
farming can be absorbed through the skin, causing fluid buildup in the airways and lungs.
Exposure to gases from a fire is often associated with chemical inhalation.
 Has there been any recent trauma?
DIB with trauma is concerning for rib fractures, pneumothorax, haemothorax, and heart or
lung bruising.

CHECK: SECONDARY EXAMINATION FINDINGS FOR
PATIENTS WITH DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING
DIB may present with changes in respiratory rate, respiratory effort, or low oxygen saturation.
Always assess ABCDE first. The initial ABCDE approach identifies and manages life-threatening
conditions. The secondary exam looks for changes in the patient’s condition or less obvious
causes which may have been missed during ABCDE. If the secondary examination identifies an
ABCDE condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE to manage it.
LOOK
Look for signs of respiratory failure:
 Accessory muscle use and increased work of breathing.
 Difficulty speaking in full sentences.
 Inability to lie down or lean back.
 Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) and mottled skin.
 Confusion, irritability, agitation.
 Poor chest wall movement.
 Cyanosis (blue skin colour, especially lips and fingertips).
Look at the pupils for size and reactivity:
 Very small pupils suggest possible opioid overdose or exposure to chemicals (including
pesticides).
 Unequal or abnormally shaped pupils suggest head injury which can cause abnormal
breathing.

Look at the face, nose and mouth:
 Cyanosis around the lips or nose suggests low oxygen levels in the blood.
 Pale inner surface of lower eyelids suggests severe anaemia.
 Swelling of the lips, tongue and mouth suggests an allergic reaction.
 Soot around the mouth or nose, burned facial hair or facial burns suggest smoke inhalation
and airway burns.
 Bleeding or swelling of the airway may be due to trauma.
Look at the neck and chest:
 Distended neck veins can be due to a back-up of blood due to heart failure, tension
pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade.
 Excessive muscle use in the neck and chest (between the ribs) suggests significant
respiratory difficulty.
 If the trachea is shifted to one side, think about tension pneumothorax or tumour.
 Swelling or redness of the neck suggests infection or trauma.
 Examine the entire neck and chest carefully for bruising, wounds or other signs of trauma.
Look at the rate and pattern of breathing:
 People with wheeze may take longer to breathe out because of narrowing of the lower
airways in the lung.
 Fast breathing can be due to dehydration, severe infection, chemical imbalance in the
blood, poisoning or anxiety.
 Slow and shallow breathing might be due to opioid overdose. Look for very small pupils
and altered mental status.
 Chest wall injury is often associated with pain that limits the ability to take deep breaths.
 A flail chest occurs when multiple rib fractures cause a segment of the rib cage to be
separated from the rest of the chest wall. The segment may appear to be moving in the
opposite direction from the rest of chest wall during breathing.
Look at the legs:
 Swelling to the both lower legs suggests heart failure as a cause of difficulty in breathing.
 Swelling to one leg may be due to a blood clot in the leg. If there is also difficulty in breathing,
this may mean that part of the clot has traveled to the lung.
Look at the skin:
 Bites can be a source of allergic reaction.
 Rashes, such as hives, can indicate allergic reaction. When associated with difficulty in
breathing, rashes can indicate widespread (systemic) infection.
 Pallor (pale skin) can indicate anaemia as a cause of DIB.
 Circumferential burns (a burn that goes entirely around a body part) to the chest can restrict
chest wall expansion and limit breathing.

Module 3: Approach to difficulty in breathing
LISTEN
Listen to the breath sounds:
 Stridor suggests partial upper airway obstruction, which may be due to a foreign object,
mass, or swelling from trauma or infection.
 Decreased or absent breath sounds suggest abnormal air movement in the lungs. This can
be due to air or fluid around the lung (pneumothorax, haemothorax, effusion), narrowing
or foreign body blockage of the airways, and infection or tumour in or around the lung.
 Wheezing, in particular, suggests lower airway obstruction such as from asthma, COPD,
allergic reaction, foreign body or tumour.
 Crackles or crepitations suggest fluid in the airspaces of the lung.
Listen to the heart sounds:
 Abnormal heart rhythms can cause the heart to pump blood abnormally, leading to poor
perfusion and a feeling of difficulty in breathing.
 Difficulty in breathing accompanied by heart murmurs can suggest damage to the heart
valves.
 Muffled or distant heart sounds accompanying low blood pressure, fast heart rate and
distended neck veins suggest pericardial tamponade.
FEEL
Feel the ribs and chest wall:
 Deformities and abnormal movement when pressing on the chest wall suggest rib fracture.
 Crepitus (crackling or popping when pressing on the skin of the chest wall) may suggest
underlying fracture or air under the skin (associated with pneumothorax).
 Unequal expansion of the chest wall suggests pneumothorax, haemothorax, or flail chest.
Percuss the chest wall [See SKILLS]:
 Hollow sounds (hyperresonance) on one side when tapping the chest wall suggest
pneumothorax.
 Dull sounds when tapping the chest wall may indicate fluid or blood either inside the
airspaces of the lungs or between the lungs and the chest wall.

DO: MANAGEMENT
FIRST PERFORM ABCDE ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENE FOR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS.
Assess and manage airway and provide bag-mask-ventilation (BVM) for any patient who is not
breathing or not breathing adequately (too slow for age or too shallow); any unconscious patient
with abnormal (slow, shallow, gasping or noisy) breathing; or any patient with a pulse who is not
breathing. For patients without a pulse, follow relevant CPR protocols.
CONDITION MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Airway inflammation Keep patients calm. Give oxygen if you can do this without upsetting the
or burns patient. [See SKILLS]
If the patient is fully alert and no spinal injury suspected, the seated
position may be more comfortable.
Patients with airway burns may require early intubation as the airway can
swell and block quickly; delays may make intubation more difficult.
A person with airway inflammation or burns requires urgent handover/
transfer.
Choking Use age-appropriate chest thrusts/abdominal thrusts/back blows.
[See SKILLS]
Allergic reaction Remove the allergen, if possible. For severe allergic reaction with difficulty
breathing give intramuscular adrenaline as soon as possible. Give oxygen
for severe cases. [See SKILLS]
Asthma/COPD Administer salbutamol as soon as possible. Give oxygen if indicated.
[See SKILLS]
Fever Give antibiotics as soon as possible if infection might be the cause of
difficulty in breathing. If the patient has signs of poor perfusion, give IV
fluids with caution to avoid fluid overload. [See SKILLS]
Heart attack Give aspirin. While oxygen is no longer recommended in all patients
with heart attack, it should initially be given to patients with shock or
difficulty in breathing. [See SKILLS] For those patients who already have
nitroglycerin, you can assist them in taking it if perfusion is adequate.
Chronic, severe Give IV fluids more slowly and check the lungs for crackles (fluid overload)
anaemia frequently. [See SKILLS] These patients may need handover/transfer for
blood transfusion.
Diabetic ketoacidosis Give IV fluids. [See SKILLS] A person with diabetic ketoacidosis is
extremely ill and requires urgent transfer to an advanced provider.
Opioid overdose Support breathing with a bag-valve-mask as needed. Give naloxone.
[See SKILLS]
Pleural effusion or Give oxygen. [See SKILLS] Arrange for handover/transfer immediately.
haemothorax Many of these patients will need a chest tube or other drainage.
Trauma All trauma patients with difficulty in breathing should be given oxygen. IV
fluid should be given to help fill the heart if either pericardial tamponade
or tension pneumothorax is suspected. Needle decompression should
be performed if tension pneumothorax is suspected. Treat sucking chest
wounds with a 3-sided dressing. [See SKILLS] The patient will need urgent
handover/transfer for a chest tube if needle decompression is performed
or a 3-sided dressing is applied.
Acute chest Give oxygen, IV fluids, antibiotics. May need transfer for advanced
syndrome management.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN
The following are danger signs in children:
• Signs of airway obstruction (unable to swallow saliva/drooling or stridor).
• Increased breathing effort (fast breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, chest indrawing or
retractions).
• Cyanosis (blue colour of the skin, especially at the lips and fingertips).
• Altered mental status (lethargy or unusual sleepiness, agitation).
• Poor feeding or drinking.
• Vomiting everything.
• Seizures/convulsions.
• Low temperature (hypothermia).
REMEMBER...
• Wheezing in children can be caused by viral infection, asthma or an inhaled object
blocking the airway.
• Stridor in children can be caused by an object stuck in the upper airway OR airway
swelling.
• Children may present with rapid breathing as the only sign of pneumonia.
• Rapid breathing can also indicate diabetic crisis (DKA), which may be the first sign of
diabetes in a child.

DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
 Keep in mind that the effects of inhaled medications such as salbutamol last for only
approximately 3 hours. Patients need to be monitored closely.
 If a patient with a severe allergic reaction is given adrenaline, the reaction can return when
the adrenaline wears off. Patients need to be monitored closely.
 Naloxone only lasts about 1 hour. Most opioid medications last longer than this, so patients
may need repeat naloxone doses.
 Following immersion in water (drowning), a person may develop late signs of breathing
problems after several hours and should be observed closely.
 Never leave patients who might need definitive airway placement unmonitored during
handover/transfer. Ensure that a new provider is monitoring the patient before leaving.
 Make transfer arrangements as early as possible for any patient who may require assisted
ventilation.

Overview
Poor perfusion is when the body is not able to get enough oxygen-carrying blood to vital
organs. When organ function is affected, this is called shock and can lead rapidly to death.
Infants, children and older adults are more likely to be affected by shock.
Causes of poor perfusion which may lead to shock include:
 loss of blood (haemorrhage);
 loss of fluid due to diarrhoea, vomiting, extensive burns or excess urination (such as caused
by high blood sugar);
 poor fluid intake. Small children, the elderly and the very ill may be unable to drink enough
fluids without assistance and are at risk of dehydration;
 abnormal relaxation and enlargement (dilation) of the blood vessels (with the same amount
of blood inside the vessel) can lower blood pressure. This can occur in severe infection,
spinal cord injury and severe allergic reaction;
 poor filling of the heart can result from blood or other fluid in the sac around the heart
(pericardial tamponade), or increased pressure in the chest that can shift and block the
vessels returning blood to the heart (tension pneumothorax);
 failure of the heart muscle to pump effectively can be due to a heart attack (vessel blockage
that causes acute heart muscle damage); inflammation or other disease of the heart muscle
itself; an abnormal rhythm or valve problems. (Shock due to failure of the heart to pump
effectively is sometimes called cardiogenic shock.)
The goal of INITIAL ASSESSMENT is to identify shock and any reversible causes of shock.
The goal of ACUTE MANAGEMENT is to restore perfusion (oxygen delivery to the organs)
and address ongoing fluid loss where possible.
This module will guide you through:
 ABCDE key elements
 ASK: key history findings (SAMPLE history)
 CHECK: secondary examination findings
 Possible causes
 DO: management
 Special considerations in children
 Disposition considerations
REMEMBER...
 ALWAYS START WITH THE ABCDE APPROACH, intervening as needed.
 Then do a SAMPLE history.
 Then do a secondary examination.
9977

--- Page 106 ---
Module 4: Approach to shock
ABCDE: KEY ELEMENTS IN SHOCK
For the person in shock, the following are key elements that should be considered in the ABCDE
approach.
AIRWAY
A
Face/mouth swelling or voice changes can indicate an allergic reaction. A
severe allergic reaction can cause shock.
BREATHING
B
Wheezing can indicate a severe allergic reaction which can cause shock.
Shock, difficulty in breathing and absent breath sounds on one side can
indicate a tension pneumothorax. Poor perfusion itself can sometimes
cause rapid breathing when vital organs do not receive enough oxygen. Severe heart failure
can cause poor perfusion with difficulty in breathing when fluid backs up into the lungs. Any
infection severe enough to cause shock may be associated with lung inflammation that causes
difficulty in breathing.
CIRCULATION
C
Shock can be caused by many types of bleeding (from the stomach or
intestines, pregnancy-related, and internal and external haemorrhage
from trauma). Shock can also result from the fluid loss associated with
diarrhoea, vomiting, extensive burns, or excess urination (such as caused by high blood sugar).
DISABILITY
D
Confusion in a person with poor perfusion suggests severe shock. Paralysis
may indicate a spinal cord injury causing shock.
EXPOSURE
E
Look for signs of bleeding, trauma, and excessive sweating (diaphoresis).
Hives can indicate allergic reaction, and other rashes can indicate systemic
infection.
ASK: KEY HISTORY FINDINGS IN SHOCK
Use the SAMPLE approach to obtain a history from the patient and/or family.
If the history identifies an ABCDE condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE
to manage it.

S: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
 Has there been vomiting and/or diarrhoea? For how long?
Fluid losses through vomiting and diarrhoea can be severe and can lead to shock. The
amount of vomiting or diarrhoea can help give a rough estimate of the risk for shock, so
always ask about frequency of episodes.
 Has the person had blood in stool or vomit?
Bleeding in the stomach and/or intestines can be severe before it is recognized. A person
can lose a significant portion of his or her blood volume in the intestines. Blood may appear
black in both vomit and stools.
 Has there been any vaginal bleeding?
Vaginal bleeding may be related to pregnancy in women of childbearing years. Always
ask about pregnancy status, last menstrual period, any missed periods, or known recent
pregnancy. Blood loss from normal delivery or miscarriage can cause shock. A pregnancy
developing outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) can also be life-threatening if it ruptures.
Ectopic pregnancy rupture can occur before a woman even knows she is pregnant. Other
causes of vaginal bleeding are masses in the cervix or uterus.
 Has the person had any chest pain?
Chest pain may suggest the person has had a heart attack. The muscle damage to the heart
from a heart attack can reduce its ability to pump blood around the body, which can cause
shock.
 Has there been fever?
Fever may suggest infection as the cause of shock. Severe infection causes both dilation of
the blood vessels (which lowers blood pressure) and fluid leakage from the blood vessels
(with fluid loss into the tissues).
 Has there been any exposure to toxins, medications, insect stings or other substances?
Severe allergic reactions can lead to shock. Additionally, many medications, including blood
pressure and seizure/convulsion medications, can cause shock.
 Has there been altered mental status or unusual sleepiness?
The brain is one of the last organs to be affected by poor perfusion, so altered mental status
may be a sign of severe shock.
A: ALLERGIES
 Does the person have any known allergies?
Allergic reactions can lead to shock by causing abnormal relaxation of the blood vessels.
9999

--- Page 108 ---
Module 4: Approach to shock
M: MEDICATIONS
 Currently taking any medications?
Obtain a full medication list from the person or the family. Knowing the patient’s medication
list can help understand why the patient is in shock (such as heart medications). Overdose
of blood pressure or seizure/convulsion medications can cause shock, and it may be more
difficult to treat shock from any cause in patients taking these medications. Medications
that thin the blood can worsen bleeding. Always ask about new medications in particular
and recent dose changes to evaluate for allergic reaction or unexpected side effects.
P: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
 History of pregnancy or recent miscarriage or delivery?
Blood loss following delivery can be severe if the uterus does not contract well. Hidden
blood loss leading to shock can occur with ruptured ectopic pregnancy, even in women
who do not know they are pregnant. Any woman of childbearing age with shock should be
evaluated for pregnancy.
 History of recent surgery or induced abortion?
Internal bleeding or infection after surgery can lead to shock.
 History of heart disease (heart attack or heart valve problems)?
Patients with heart disease are at risk for worsening heart function that may lead to shock
or worsen shock from other causes.
 Is there a history of HIV?
HIV increases the risk of infection.
L: LAST ORAL INTAKE
 When did the person last eat or drink?
A person who is not eating or drinking well can develop severe dehydration, leading to shock.
E: EVENTS SURROUNDING ILLNESS
 Has there been any recent trauma?
Trauma can cause hidden internal bleeding, tension pneumothorax, and bruising or
bleeding around the heart, all of which may reduce blood flow and cause shock. In addition,
trauma to the neck or back causing spinal cord injury can interfere with the blood vessels’
ability to maintain blood pressure.
 Has there been any recent illness?
Any infection can cause a blood infection that can spread throughout the body and lead
to shock.

would ask when taking a SAMPLE history.

4. ______________________________________________________________________

CHECK: SECONDARY EXAMINATION FINDINGS IN SHOCK
A person with shock will have signs of poor perfusion, which may include a fast heart rate, a
low systolic blood pressure, fast breathing, pale and cool skin, slow capillary refill, dizziness,
confusion, altered mental status, decreased urine output or excessive sweating.
REMEMBER: Perfusion can be limited even before blood pressure falls, especially in the young.
Low blood pressure with poor perfusion is a very serious sign.
Always assess ABCDE first. The initial ABCDE approach identifies and manages life-threatening
conditions. The secondary exam looks for changes in the patient’s condition or less obvious
causes that may have been missed during ABCDE. If the secondary examination identifies an
ABCDE condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE to manage it.
REMEMBER: Children have different normal vital signs ranges, and children with shock may
not have changes in vital signs until they are very ill. Always do a careful exam for any signs of
shock.
 Check breath sounds and respiratory rate:
– Abnormal or noisy breathing can indicate pneumonia as a source for system-wide
infection causing shock.
– High sugar levels can result in chemical imbalance (diabetic ketoacidosis) that the body
tries to address by faster or deeper breathing. This condition may also result in sweet or
‘fruity’ smelling breath. Since elevated blood glucose levels cause increased urination,
severe dehydration and shock can result.
 Check for bleeding:
– All external bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure. [See SKILLS] Arterial
bleeding may appear as pulsing or high pressure bleeding, and significant blood volume
can be lost in minutes.
110011

--- Page 110 ---
Module 4: Approach to shock
– Vaginal bleeding may be an important source of blood loss from pregnancy-related
bleeding (even in those who think they are not pregnant) or from masses in the cervix
or uterus.
 Check fluid status:
In dehydration states, the patient may feel thirsty or may have dry lips and mouth, abnormal
skin pinch, lethargy, and delayed capillary refill. Patients with heart failure can be in shock
with fluid overload, and may have lower body swelling (usually in both legs), crackles on
lung examination, and distended neck veins.
 Check for pale conjunctiva (the inside of the lower eyelid):
No matter the person’s skin color, the inside of the eyelid should appear pink and moist. If
the inner portion of the eyelid (conjunctiva) is pale, it may indicate significant blood loss.
You can compare the patient’s conjunctiva to another healthy person or look at your own
in a mirror.
 Check mental status:
Confusion in a patient with other signs of poor perfusion suggests severe shock.
 Check for fever:
Fever in a patient with shock suggests severe infection.
 Check blood sugar:
Low blood glucose can sometimes look like shock. If you cannot check blood glucose, but
the person has altered mental status, a history of diabetes or another reason to have low
sugar (for example, is taking quinine for malaria, is very ill, or is very malnourished), give
glucose. [See SKILLS]
 Check for severe abdominal pain or a very firm abdomen:
If the person has severe abdominal pain, this can be a sign of bleeding or infection in the
abdomen. In a patient who might be pregnant, this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.
 Check urine:
Check the urine colour and volume. Small amounts of darker urine may indicate substantial
dehydration.
 Check stool:
Any significant diarrhoea can cause dehydration. A large amount of watery, “rice-water”
stool suggests cholera, which can rapidly cause severe dehydration and shock. Black, dark,
or reddish colored stool can suggest stomach or intestinal bleeding.

DO: MANAGEMENT
FIRST PERFORM ABCDE ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENE FOR LIFE-
THREATENING CONDITIONS.
Start by giving IV fluid (normal saline or Ringer’s Lactate in adults and children with normal
nutritional status). Then work to address underlying causes. Place IV access rapidly (two
large-bore IVs) and start IV fluids. Place IV access rapidly (two large-bore IVs), start IV fluids and
assess response. Repeat with additional boluses if needed. [See SKILLS] If you cannot place an
IV, immediately call for a provider who can place a nasogastric tube (a tube that goes from the
nose into the stomach) or intraosseous line (a needle that is placed directly into the bone). See
if the patient can safely take oral fluids in the meantime.
CAUTION! For severely malnourished or severely anaemic people, or anyone with signs
of volume overload, do NOT follow the fluid protocol below. Use adjusted protocol. [See

arranging for transport and during transport, it is important to try to stop the bleeding.
Give BOTH intramuscular and IV oxytocin. This is a loading dose. After these doses, continue page 17
oxytocin IV until one hour after the bleeding stops. [See SKILLS] Bleeding frequently happens
if the uterus is not fully contracted (does not feel hard on palpation). Perform uterine massage
[See SKILLS] until the uterus is hard. You should use BOTH oxytocin and uterine massage to
stop the bleeding. If the placenta delivers,
collect it in a leak-proof container and
keep with the patient to allow the
advanced obstetric provider to examine it.
Visually check externally for a perineal or
vaginal tear. If found, apply direct pressure
with sterile gauze and put legs together.
Even if the bleeding stops, these patients
still need rapid handover/transfer to an
advanced obstetric provider (see figure).

4. Transfer immediately
REMEMBER... fluid only addresses the immediate problem of perfusion. Patients with shock
need rapid handover/transfer to a unit capable of addressing the causes of shock and providing
advanced management, including transfusion.
REMEMBER... fluid status assessment is critical. Patients who have signs of poor perfusion but
overall volume overload can be particularly difficult to manage. Patients with malnutrition,
severe anaemia, and excess fluid in the lungs due to heart, liver, or kidney failure can present
this way. These patients still need fluids, but the fluids must be given cautiously and, especially
in malnourished children, according to a specific protocol. [See SKILLS]
110099

Module 4: Approach to shock
DO: MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC CONDITIONS
• Always perform ABCDE first. Patients in shock need oxygen.
• In all forms of shock, the primary management is administration of IV fluids
appropriate for age and condition.
• The specific conditions below require additional considerations.
CONDITION MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Burns • Burns disrupt the skin barrier and can cause significant fluid
losses that can lead to shock. These patients have different fluid
replacement needs. [See SKILLS]
Hyperglycaemia • If concern for diabetic ketoacidosis, treat with IV fluids.
[See SKILLS] A person with diabetic ketoacidosis is extremely ill
and requires rapid transfer to a unit where IV infusion and close
monitoring are available.
Fever • Give fluids and start antibiotics. [See SKILLS] If infectious
diarrhoea (like cholera) is suspected, use gloves, aprons and
relevant isolation precautions and report it to the local public
health agency. If signs of poor perfusion do not improve with
fluids, consider rapid handover/transfer.
Spinal cause • Give IV fluids and refer for ongoing management at a unit that
can provide spinal care. [See SKILLS]
Stomach or intestinal • Start IV fluids and refer for blood transfusion. [See SKILLS]
bleeding
Ectopic pregnancy • Give IV fluids and refer for blood transfusion and obstetric care.
[See SKILLS]
Postpartum haemorrhage • Give oxytocin and IV fluids and plan for rapid transfer to facility
with blood transfusion and obstetric care capabilities.
• Give IV fluids and massage uterus until it is hard. [See SKILLS]
• Give oxytocin. [See SKILLS]
• If the placenta has delivered, collect it in a leak-proof container
and keep with patient for inspection by advanced provider.
• Check for perineal and vaginal tears and apply direct pressure.
Tension pneumothorax • Perform needle decompression immediately to relieve the
pressure, give oxygen and IV fluids. [See SKILLS] Any patient
who has had a needle decompression will need rapid handover/
transfer to a unit that can place a chest tube.
Pericardial tamponade • Give IV fluids to help fill the heart against the building pressure
in the heart sac. [See SKILLS] Plan for rapid handover/transfer to
a provider who can drain the pericardial fluid.

CONDITION MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Suspected heart attack • Give aspirin if indicated. Place an IV and give fluids, re-assessing
the patient frequently. [See SKILLS]
• While oxygen is no longer recommended in all patients with
heart attack, it should initially be given in patients with shock or
difficulty in breathing, even when heart attack is the suspected
cause.
• Plan for rapid handover/transfer to advanced provider.
Heart failure • Give IV fluids more slowly, checking the lungs for crackles
(fluid overload) frequently. Stop IV fluids if fluid overload
develops (difficulty in breathing, crackles in the lungs, increased
respiratory rate, increased heart rate). [See SKILLS]
• Plan for rapid handover/transfer to an advanced provider.
Severe allergic reaction • Give intramuscular adrenaline [See SKILLS]. These patients will
also need IV access and fluids as their condition can rapidly
worsen once the adrenaline wears off. You may give a second
dose if the effects wear off. [See SKILLS] If the airway is swollen or
there is difficulty in breathing, patients may need rapid transfer.
Traumatic injury or rapid • Stop the bleeding, give IV fluids, and conduct a thorough
trauma assessment. [See SKILLS] Refer for blood transfusion and

Module 4: Approach to shock
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN
Shock can occur quite rapidly in children and is life-threatening. Children have a
relatively larger surface area (compared to their body volume) and are thus likely to
become dehydrated more rapidly. Infants and young children are particularly at risk as
they are unable to say when they are thirsty and cannot drink more on their own.
Assessing shock in children: The clinical definition of shock in children varies. The 2016
WHO guidelines for the care of critically ill children use the presence of three clinical
features: cold extremities, capillary refill greater than 3 seconds, and weak and fast pulse.
There are also other important signs of poor perfusion, including low blood pressure,
fast breathing, altered mental status, and decreased urination (always ask parents how
much urine the child is passing). [See SKILLS]
Signs of dehydration in children
• Very dry mouth and lips
• Lethargy (excessive drowsiness and slowness to respond), child not interactive
page 34
• Sunken eyes
• Small amounts of dark urine (ask about number of nappies for infants)
• Sunken fontanelles in infants under 1 year
• Delayed capillary refill (normal capillary refill is less than 3 seconds)
• Abnormal skin pinch [See SKILLS]
• Pallor (anaemia makes dehydration even more difficult to treat [See SKILLS])
Abnormal skin pinch in a child
Common causes of shock and dehydration in children include:
• Vomiting and diarrhoeaA: bGnaosrtmroael nstkeirnit ips inccahu sines a scuhdildden onset of vomiting and
diarrhoea with some abdominal pain and fever. Large amount of watery diarrhoea
may suggest cholera, and needs to be reported to public health authorities.
• Vomiting without diarrhoea: Vomiting without diarrhoea or fever may suggest raised
pressure on the brain (trauma, tumour, brain swelling), or intestinal blockage. It is
important to examine the child for signs of trauma. Vomiting associated with fever
may suggest infection.
• Overwhelming infection: Fever can cause children to become dehydrated quickly. In
addition, overwhelming infection can cause blood vessels to dilate, worsening shock.

Special management considerations:
• Malnourishment: Malnourished children are at high risk for hypoglycaemia and
will need sugar in addition to fluids. Give specialized fluids if available. [See SKILLS]
Give less IV fluid more slowly, and check the lungs for crackles (fluid overload) every
5 minutes. Stop IV fluids if fluid overload develops (crackles in the lungs, increased
respiratory rate, increased heart rate). Switch to oral fluids as soon as signs of poor
perfusion improve. These patients need rapid handover/transfer over to an advanced
provider at a centre with blood transfusion capabilities.

DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
 People with shock can worsen and die quickly. They must be monitored very closely.
 Additionally, the same illnesses that cause shock interfere with the body’s ability to manage
fluids, so these patients must be monitored very closely for signs of difficulty in breathing.
 Patients with shock may be confused and anxious. Ensure they are safe and contained
during transfer.
 Patients with shock are often transferred for transfusion or general or obstetric surgery.
Always communicate directly with the receiving facility to make sure that these resources
are actually available at the time of transfer.

Overview
Altered mental status (AMS) is a term used for a range of presentations, from sudden or gradual
changes in behaviour to disorientation, confusion and coma. Changes in mental status and/or
level of consciousness may be due to conditions that affect the brain (such as lack of oxygen or
glucose; or shock causing lack of perfusion) or problems with the brain itself (such as infection,
inflammation or injury). While chronic psychiatric problems and dementia can cause changes
in mental status, altered mental status is often an indication of severe disease, and other life-
threatening causes must always be considered. The presence of delirium – a rapidly changing
state of confusion with agitation, loss of focus and inability to interact appropriately – always
requires a full assessment. Always ask family/friends about baseline mental status when possible.
The goal of INITIAL ASSESSMENT is to identify rapidly reversible causes of altered
mental status, and to recognize dangerous conditions requiring transfer.
The goal of ACUTE MANAGEMENT is to ensure that blood, oxygen and glucose reach
the brain; and to protect the brain from additional injury.
This module will guide you through:
 ABCDE key elements
 ASK: key history findings (SAMPLE history)
 CHECK: secondary exam findings
 Possible causes
 DO: Management
 Special considerations in children
 Disposition considerations
REMEMBER...
 ALWAYS START WITH THE ABCDE APPROACH, intervening as needed.
 Then do a SAMPLE history.
 Then do a secondary exam.

Module 5: Approach to altered mental status
ABCDE: KEY ELEMENTS FOR ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
For the person with altered mental status, the following are key elements that should be
considered in the ABCDE approach.
AIRWAY
A
People with altered mental status may not be able to protect their airways
and may be at risk of choking on vomit.
BREATHING
B
Hypoxia (lack of oxygen) can be a cause of altered mental status. Search
for any signs of difficulty breathing, or cyanosis (blue colouring of the skin).
Abnormal breathing can reflect diabetic ketoacidosis or poisoning.
CIRCULATION
C
Lack of perfusion to the brain can cause altered mental status. Look for
and manage signs of shock (low blood pressure, elevated heart rate,
delayed capillary refill).
DISABILITY
D
Check AVPU or GCS (in trauma). Look for abnormal glucose (hypoglycaemia
or hyperglycaemia can cause altered mental status). Very small pupils
suggest opioid overdose or poisoning (consider pesticides). Very dilated
pupils suggest stimulant drug use. Unequal pupils suggest an increased pressure on the
brain. If the patient can follow commands, test for strength and sensation in face, arms and
legs. Weakness or loss of sensation on one side suggests a mass, bleeding, or blocked blood
vessels in the brain (stroke), though hypoglycemia can also present this way. Altered mental
status with general muscle weakness may suggest salt (electrolyte) imbalance in the blood.
Look for abnormal repetitive movements or shaking on one or both sides of the body (seizure/
convulsion) – this may be due to a tumour, bleeding, brain infection, hypoglycaemia, or salt
(electrolyte) imbalance.
EXPOSURE
E
Remember that patients with altered mental status may not report their
history accurately. Examine the entire body for infections, rashes, and
any evidence of trauma, bites or stings. Needle marks on the arms may
suggest drugs as a cause.
ASK: KEY HISTORY FINDINGS FOR PATIENTS WITH ALTERED
MENTAL STATUS
Use the SAMPLE approach to obtain a history from the patient and/or family. It is important
to obtain a history from bystanders, friends or family as it may be difficult to obtain accurate
history from a confused patient. For example, a person with hypoglycaemia may be too
confused to relate a history of diabetes.
If the history identifies an ABCDE condition, STOP AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE
to manage it.

S: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
 How does the current condition compare to baseline mental status?
Always ask family/friends about baseline mental status when possible.
 Is there difficulty breathing?
Altered mental status associated with difficulty in breathing may indicate lack of oxygen to
the brain.
 Is there headache?
Headache with altered mental status can indicate infection, tumour or bleeding.
 Is there vomiting/diarrhoea?
Vomiting without diarrhoea can be a sign of increased pressure in the brain. Any source of
dehydration, including vomiting and diarrhoea, may cause altered mental status from poor
perfusion. Vomiting and diarrhoea can also cause hypoglycaemia leading to altered mental
status.
 Has there been any dizziness or fainting?
These may be signs of poor perfusion (lack of oxygenated blood) to the brain.
 When did the symptoms start? Do they come and go? How long do they last? Have they
changed over time?
Rapid onset of altered mental status may suggest infection, inflamation, bleeding or drugs/
toxic exposures. A more gradual onset (over weeks or months) may indicate a space-
occupying lesion in the brain, such as a tumour or slow bleeding in the brain. Altered mental
status that comes and goes with normal intervals between episodes may suggest other
causes, such as seizures/convulsions or psychiatric disease.
 Has there been any recent fever?
Any person with altered mental status and fever may have an infection. Brain infections
often present with altered mental status and fever. In small children and the elderly, any
serious infection, such as urine, lung, or blood infection can cause altered mental status.
Also consider prolonged outdoor exposure, poisonings, medications and drugs as these
may present with fever as well. Very high fever itself from any source may cause altered
mental status.
 Is there any weakness, clumsiness or difficulty walking?
Change in mental status with weakness or sensory loss in one area of the body, or problems
with walking and balance, suggest that the altered mental status comes from a cause in the
brain itself, such as a stroke or tumour.
 Is there neck pain or stiffness?
Fluid that circulates around the brain also circulates around the spinal cord, meaning any
bleeding, inflammation or infection in the brain (meningitis, encephalitis) can also cause
neck pain and stiffness.

Module 5: Approach to altered mental status
 Is there a recent history of trauma or falls?
Bleeding in or around the brain can cause altered mental status some days after an injury.
Remember that chronic alcohol drinkers and the elderly are more prone to brain bleeding
and may not remember falls. Always consider slow bleeding around the brain as a cause,
even several days after a fall, and consider unwitnessed trauma in a patient who is found
altered with no known cause.
 Has there been any recent depression or changes in behaviour?
Drug and alcohol use or psychiatric problems can present as altered mental status. Always
consider the possibility of a suicide attempt by poisoning.
 Does anyone else from the same family or location have symptoms?
Gaseous poisoning, like carbon monoxide poisoning, can cause altered mental status in
multiple people. Carbon monoxide poisoning is usually seen in cold climates when people
use indoor heating.
A: ALLERGIES
 Any allergies or recent exposure to a known allergen?
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) may present with altered mental status due to low
blood oxygen levels or poor blood circulation to the brain as a result of shock.
M: MEDICATIONS
 Currently taking any medications?
Many common medications can cause altered mental status as a side effect, including
those for seizures/convulsions, pain and sleeping. Ask about new medications and changed
doses, and consider medication interactions. A medication list should be collected and can
provide clues for underlying disease (such as convulsions, liver disease, diabetes) if the
person cannot communicate. Opioid medications (such as morphine, pethidine and heroin)
can cause altered mental status.
P: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
 History of diabetes?
In any patient with diabetes and altered mental status, suspect diabetic crisis, or low blood
sugar caused by medications. Recent increase in urine output, increased thirst, and fast or
deep breathing suggest diabetic crisis (diabetic ketoacidosis).
 History of heart disease?
Heart attack can cause decreased blood flow and oxygen to the brain leading to confusion.
Those with heart disease are also at an increased risk of stroke.

 History of stroke?
Altered mental status in a patient with a history of stroke may suggest an additional stroke
or bleeding in the brain. Be sure to ask people who know the patient about his or her usual
mental and neurological status. Symptoms of old stroke may return with severe illness of
any kind.
 History of high blood pressure?
High blood pressure increases the risk for bleeding in and around the brain (such as stroke).
 History of seizure/convulsion?
Altered mental status in a patient with a history of seizures/convulsions may suggest that
the patient is having or recovering from a convulsion. If there is a history of epilepsy (primary
seizure/convulsion disorder), ask about regular medication and any recent dose changes
or missed doses. With a witnessed convulsion, ask about fall or head trauma. Always ask
if the convulsion was the same or different compared to prior. Remember that recovery
of normal mental status after convulsions usually takes only a half hour to several hours
at most, though patients may feel tired for longer. Longer altered mental status suggests
another cause.
 History of HIV infection?
Altered mental status in a person with HIV may suggest infection in or around the brain
(meningitis, encephalitis).
 History of tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis can infect the brain and cause altered mental status.
 History of liver or kidney failure?
Liver or kidney failure can cause problems with the clearing of toxins and waste from the
blood, which can lead to altered mental status.
 History of heavy alcohol use?
Alcohol intoxication and alcohol withdrawal can present with altered mental status. People
with a history of heavy alcohol use also have a high risk for head injury (and may not
remember falls) and hypoglycaemia, both of which can cause altered mental status.
 Use of drugs of abuse?
Several drugs of abuse cause altered mental status, including stimulants, sedatives and
opioids.
 History of pregnancy?
High blood pressure during pregnancy can lead to eclampsia (or seizures/convulsions and
high blood pressure) during pregnancy.
L: LAST ORAL INTAKE
 When did the person last eat or drink?
Low blood glucose levels and dehydration can cause altered mental status.
112255

--- Page 134 ---
Module 5: Approach to altered mental status
E: EVENTS SURROUNDING ILLNESS
 Recent trauma?
Both head injury and poor perfusion resulting from blood loss can cause altered mental status.
 Recent travel to areas where certain types of infections might be more common?
Specific infections that can cause altered mental status may be more common in certain
areas. Malaria is a key consideration in many areas.
 Recent exposures: contact with a sick person, recent bites, chemical exposures, hot or
cold environments etc.?
Sick contacts may suggest infectious cause. Chemical exposures (such as pesticides) or bites
may suggest intoxication or envenomation. Altered mental status can be caused by both
very low and very high body temperatures.
 Recent alcohol or drug use?
Both alcohol intoxication and alcohol withdrawal can cause altered mental status.
Methamphetamines and cocaine may cause severe agitation, while heroin (and other
opioids) may cause lethargy and coma. See also “Past medical history” section above.

CHECK: SECONDARY EXAMINATION FINDINGS IN ALTERED
MENTAL STATUS
A person with altered mental status may be unable to answer questions, and clues to the
cause may only be found during the physical examination. Always assess ABCDE first. The
initial ABCDE approach identifies and manages life-threatening conditions. The secondary

PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK
examination looks for changes in the patient’s condition or less obvious causes that may have
been missed during ABCDE. If the secondary examination identifies an ABCDE condition, STOP
AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO ABCDE to manage it.
 Check for safety:
Agitated and violent behaviour is a common presentation. It is very important to identify
and treat the underlying cause if possible, while prioritizing the safety of the patient and
providers. Keep calm and work as a team. Ensure that the space is safe from possible
weapons and make sure that the patient is not between you and the door. Avoid making
the patient feel threatened. Do not sit too close and speak with a calm, soft and sympathetic
voice. Continually explain what is happening. Many aggressive patients will cooperate when
faced with a team, so call for help and approach a patient as a group if necessary. Check vital
signs, including temperature and glucose, and treat abnormalities. Call for help early and
arrange handover/transfer to an advanced provider.
 Check and monitor level of consciousness with the AVPU scale:
– A: Alert
– V: Responds to Voice
– P: Responds to Pain
– U: Unresponsive
AVPU tests the person’s ability to respond to stimuli. A person who is not intoxicated and
who has no illness or injury affecting the brain will usually be alert without being prompted.
Patients who only respond when prompted by voice or pain require further assessment of
the neurological system. [See SKILLS]
 In trauma, check Glasgow Coma Scale:
Check and monitor the Glasgow Coma Scale. [See SKILLS]
 Check the blood glucose level:
Hypoglycaemia can cause altered mental status. Diabetic ketoacidosis can present with
hyperglycaemia and altered mental status.
 Check the pupils:
Very small pupils and slow breathing suggests opioid overdose. Very large (dilated) pupils
suggest stimulant drug use. Unequal pupils suggest increased pressure on the brain.
 Check for orientation:
If the patient is alert and responds to voice, ask simple questions (for example: What is your
name? Where are you? What time is it? What day of the week is it?).
 Check for trauma:
Any patient with altered mental status and history or evidence of trauma should be
considered to have a possible head injury – even if the trauma occurred several days before.
Bruising around the eyes, behind the ears, or leaking of clear fluid from the nose or ears
suggests head injury with skull fracture.
 Check temperature:
Fever should raise concerns about an infectious cause, and fever with stiff neck suggests
an infection in or around the brain. Poisonings, medication overdoses, alcohol withdrawal
112277

--- Page 136 ---
Module 5: Approach to altered mental status
and changes in body hormones can also present with fever. Hypothermia may indicate
infection, low body hormone levels (e.g., thyroid) or exposure to wet or cold environments.
 Check for stiff neck (Remember, if you suspect trauma, do not move the neck):
Stiff neck is suggestive of infection (meningitis) or bleeding around the brain. If you suspect
infection, anyone who comes in contact with the patient should wear a mask.
 Check strength and sensation:
If the patient can follow commands, test for strength and sensation in face, arms and legs.
Weakness or loss of sensation on one side suggests a mass, bleeding or blocked blood
vessels in the brain (stroke), though hypoglycaemia can also present this way. Altered
mental status with general muscle weakness may suggest salt (electrolyte) imbalance in
the blood.
 Check for signs of dehydration:
Dehydration can cause altered mental status. Check for dry mouth and abnormal skin pinch.
Dehydration may also suggest diabetic ketoacidosis.
 Check the abdomen:
Feel if the liver is enlarged or tender. A palpable or tender liver suggests liver disease.
 Check the skin:
Cool, pale, and moist skin suggests shock or hypoglycaemia. Yellow skin (jaundice) suggests
liver disease. Bruising suggests trauma. Rashes can indicate systemic infection. Check for
bites and stings.
 Monitor for changes in mental status:
People who are initially confused and rapidly return to normal without treatment may have
had a seizure/convulsion or head trauma. People with altered mental status require close
monitoring to make sure they do not worsen again. (This can happen in patients who have
low blood sugar or head trauma).

Hypoglycaemia Treat with glucose. [See SKILLS]
Hyperglycaemia If concern for diabetic ketoacidosis, treat with IV fluids. [See SKILLS]
A person with diabetic ketoacidosis is extremely ill and requires
rapid transfer to a unit where IV infusion and close monitoring are
available.
Fever (hyperthermia) with Start antibiotics. Severe infections may require treatment by an
altered mental status advanced provider. Include malaria testing and treatment in
endemic areas. Also consider poisoning and envenomation. Treat
high fever with paracetamol. [See SKILLS] For severe temperature
elevation, spray with cool water mist, fan and give IV fluids. Avoid
shivering.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN
Children with altered mental status may have seemingly mild signs such as sleeping
more than usual or being less interactive. Manage ABCDE first, and then look for and
manage causes of altered mental status. Remember that very ill or injured children may
have normal vital signs until they rapidly deteriorate.
Hypoglycaemia occurs frequently in severely ill children and is a common cause of
altered mental status in children. Check blood glucose (or give glucose if you are unable
to check) in any child with altered mental status.
Hypoxia can occur as a result of many conditions, including respiratory infections and
shock; birth hypoxia is a consideration in newborns.
Hyperthermia with altered mental status suggests infection, but can also be seen with
excessive heat exposure, exercise, seizure/convulsion, hormonal imbalance and some
medications and poisons.
Hypothermia with altered mental status can also suggest infection, particularly in
infants, but can be due to drug intoxication, exposure to cold or hormonal imbalance.
Young infants are more affected by variation in temperature. Keep the child warm by
using blankets and a hat to prevent heat loss and using skin-to-skin contact (also called
“kangaroo care”) with a family member 24-hours per day while ill.
Seizures/convulsions can be due to fever alone but (as in adults) can also suggest
infection, hypoglycaemia or hyponatremia (low sodium). Do not delay antibiotics in
patients with suspected serious bacterial infection. Always consider trauma.
Infection in or around the brain can cause altered mental status. Look for a bulging or
page 31
swollen fontanelle (in a child under 1 year) and/or rash to the legs and lower abdomen,
which can indicate infection or increased pressure on the brain. Do not delay antibiotics
in children with suspected serious bacterial infection.
Flat fontanelle Bulging fontanelle
Poor perfusion can cause altered mental status. Children can become dehydrated very
quickly. Check for signs of dehydration: abnormal skin pinch, dry mucous membranes
Flat fontanelle Bulging fontanelle
(the inner, pink part of the mouth), irritability, sunken or depressed fontanelle (in a child
under 1 year), slow capillary refill (greater than 3 seconds), cold extremities, tachycardia,
and hypotension. Give IV fluids and re-assess frequently. [See SKILLS]
113355

--- Page 144 ---
Module 5: Approach to altered mental status
Malaria may be more severe in children than adults. Children with severe malaria may
present with severe anaemia, seizure/convulsions, coma, and hypoglycaemia.
Ingestion of chemicals or drugs is common in children. Try to identify the poison (talk
to parents) and try to get a photograph of the package. Consult advanced provider
immediately for management.
Consider unwitnessed ingestions in children aged under 6 years
(especially aged 1–3):
• Ask about signs and symptoms depending on the substance ingested.
• Take a thorough history from the family.
• Examine the bottles of the ingested substance or medicine.
• Determine what time it took place.
• Ensure that no other children were involved.
• Check for signs of burns in or around the mouth
• Check for stridor (high-pitched noises) suggesting ingestion of chemicals that burned
or damaged the airway and are causing swelling.
• Children with ingestion of drugs or chemicals need to be monitored closely and may
require handover/transfer to a referral unit for further management.

DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
Disposition depends on the cause of altered mental status. Causes of altered mental status
that cannot be rapidly corrected or which might return after medications wear off need
management in a hospital setting.
 Any patient with altered mental status must be closely monitored for airway problems.
Consider handover/transfer to a provider with advanced airway capabilities.
 If the underlying cause of the low blood glucose is not identified and treated, patients with
hypoglycaemia who improved with glucose may develop low blood glucose again and may
require repeat treatments. These patients need to be monitored closely.
 Naloxone (opioid reversal agent) effects only last approximately 1 hour. Many opioid
medications are longer-acting and may need more doses of naloxone to reverse the opioid
effects. Any patient treated with naloxone must be monitored closely. Make sure the new
provider knows the patient has been given naloxone and may need additional doses.
FACILITATOR-LED CASE SCENARIOS
These case scenarios will be presented in small groups. One participant will be identified
as the lead and will be assessed, while the rest of the group writes the responses in the
workbook. To complete a case scenario, the group must identify the critical findings
and management needed, and formulate a one-line summary for handover, including
assessment findings and interventions. You should use the Quick Card for these scenarios
while being assessed.
CASE #1: ADULT WITH ALTERED MENTAL STATUS

AIRWAY SKILL STATION: BASIC AIRWAY MANOEUVRES
Opening the airway: adult head-tilt and chin-lift
To be used for patients with altered mental status who may
not be able to protect the airway, with NO history of trauma:
• Place person face up on flat, firm surface.
• Tilt the head back with one hand and lift the chin with your
fingers.
– To do this, place one hand on the patient’s forehead and
then place two fingers of the other hand on the chin.
Rotate your hands, tilting the chin up away from the chest.
• Remove foreign bodies if visible.
• Use suction to remove any liquids or secretions from the
airway if needed.
Adult head-tilt and chin lift
• Hold the airway open – do not let the head drop back as this
will close the airway.
Opening the airway: paediatric head-tilt and chin-lift Adult head-tilt and chin-lift
To be used with patients with altered mental status who may not be able to protect the airway,
with NO history of trauma:
• Remember, children’s heads are bigger than adults’ heads compared to body size, and their
airways are softer and easier to block when the neck is bent. In older children, the airway can be
opened by tilting the head backwards slightly (see figure).
• Babies have the largest heads relative to their body size. Their heads should be placed in neutral
(sniffing) position (see figure).
• Inspect the mouth and remove visible foreign bodies. Take care not to push the foreign body
deeper into the airway.

there IS a history of trauma (cervical spine fracture is possible):
• Ask an assistant to immobilize the cervical spine while you perform the jaw thrust. [See SKILLS]
• Place fingers behind the angle of mandible (the curve on the jaw bone) on both sides of the jaw
and push up so that the lower jaw moves. The head and neck should NOT move.
• Inspect the mouth and remove foreign bodies if visible.
• Use suction to remove any liquids or secretions from the airway if needed.
• Hold the jaw in place to keep the airway open – do not let the jaw drop back as this will close the
airway.

AIRWAY SKILL STATION: MANAGEMENT OF CHOKING
Managing choking in an adult or larger child
If respiratory distress occurs suddenly while eating, a person is clutching the throat, or there is silent
coughing, cyanosis (skin turns blue in colour), stridor or noisy breathing, suspect a foreign body
obstructing the airway.
Encourage the person to speak or cough if possible and observe if the obstruction is removed. Do
not perform the manoeuvres described below if the person is audibly coughing and/or able to
make sounds.
A person who is unable to speak or cough has complete airway obstruction and needs immediate
help:
• Tell the person that you are going to provide help.
• Deliver five abdominal thrusts (see below for modifications for pregnant women).
– Stand behind the person and lean the person forward.
– Form a fist with one hand and place it in the centre of the abdomen between the umbilicus
(belly button) and the bottom portion of breastbone.
– Place your other hand over your fist.
– NOTE: If the patient is pregnant, place the side of your fist in the center of the chest and pull
sharply inward.
– Pull in and up five times using hard, quick thrusts. This forces the air out of the patient’s lungs to
try to “blow out” the obstruction.
– If the obstruction persists, have the person bend at the waist and give five back blows (with the
heel of your hand, strike the back between the shoulder blades in the direction towards the
head).
– Re-assess.
– Repeat abdominal thrusts followed by back blows until patient speaks, coughs or becomes
unconscious.
– If the choking person becomes unconscious, lie him/her face up on a firm surface. Performing
chest thrusts may relieve the obstruction. If a series of chest thrusts is not successful, continue
with rescue breaths and chest compressions based on relevant CPpRa gper o5tocols. page 6

SKILLS
Managing choking in an infant or small child
• Lay the infant on your arm or thigh in face down position with the head lower than the abdomen.
• Give five back blows (with the heel of your hand, striking the back sharply between the shoulder
blades in the direction towards the head).
• If obstruction persists, turn the infant over.
• Give five chest thrust with two fingers, just below the nipple line in the midline of the chest.
• If obstruction persists, check infant’s mouth for any visible obstruction that can be removed.
(Caution for biting.)
• If necessary, repeat entire process until the foreign body is removed.

AIRWAY SKILL STATION: AIRWAY SUCTIONING
The purpose of suctioning is to remove any liquids or secretions from the upper airway. Suctioning
may be necessary to maintain an open airway if a person cannot clear secretions without help.
• Check to see if your suction canister or handheld device is working.
• Attach a rigid or soft suction catheter to the end of the suction tubing.
• Explain what you are doing.
• Insert the suction catheter into the back of the mouth (only as far back as you can see), cover
the side hole on the catheter (NOT the tip of the catheter) to create suction. Suction only while
pulling the catheter out and release suction when advancing the catheter forward (advancing the
catheter further into the mouth while suctioning can cause injury). Repeat to suction all of the
fluid in the back of the mouth.
• Do not suction for more than 10 seconds at a time unless the airway is completely blocked with fluid.
• To avoid trauma to the mouth, do not place the end of the suction tip directly against the soft
tissue or hold it in just one place. Suction only in the oral cavity, do not suction up the nose.
AIRWAY SKILL STATION: BASIC AIRWAY DEVICE INSERTION
Oropharyngeal airway (OPA) insertion
• An oropharyngeal airway (OPA) should only be inserted when the person is unconscious. A
conscious person will not tolerate an OPA and will push it out. If the person resists, gags or vomits,
remove the device immediately.
• Always protect the cervical spine when there is a history of trauma.
• Measure the appropriate size of the OPA by measuring from the tip of the earlobe to the corner of
the mouth.
• Open the person’s mouth using care not to insert your fingers between the teeth (to avoid
accidentally being bitten).
• Insert the OPA with the curved portion sideways and the tip pointing towards the cheek.
• Push the OPA gently into the mouth and, when you can push no further, rotate the OPA 90
degrees, so that the tip now points down the throat and follows the curve of the tongue (see
figure).
• Push the OPA the remainder of the way in if necessary so that the flange (the wide, flat end) page 10
rests on the person’s lips. If you have to do this, be sure that the tip of the OPA does not push the
tongue down to obstruct the back of the throat.
• Check again to make sure the OPA did not push the tongue down and obstruct the airway.
• Give oxygen if available.

SKILLS
Nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) insertion
Nasopharyngeal airways (NPA) are better tolerated in people who are semi-conscious or when there
is a possibility of gagging with oropharyngeal airways. DO NOT use an NPA in people with head and
facial trauma.
• Assess the nasal passage for any obvious airway obstruction.
page 9
• Determine the appropriate size NPA to insert. Measure from the base of the nostrils to the earlobe.
The diameter of the NPA itself needs to be smaller than the person’s nasal passage.
• Lubricate the NPA well and insert it into the nostril, directing it along the floor of the nose posteriorly
towards the throat until the wide, flat portion (flange) of the tube rests against the nostril.
• Give oxygen if available.

2. BREATHING SKILL STATIONS
BREATHING SKILL STATION: BREATHING EXAM
• Assess and count the rate of breathing (normal is between 10–20 breaths per minute in an adult.
See ABCDE module for normal paediatric values).
• Look for increased work of breathing (nasal flaring, retractions or chest in-drawing).
• Feel for chest rise and chest wall tenderness.
• Percuss the chest wall:
– Place one hand on the chest with fingers separated (the middle finger should lie between the ribs).
– With the other hand, tap on the middle finger of the first hand and listen for changes in tone
(hollow or dull).
• Listen to the chest:
– Always expose the chest. Never listen through clothes.
– Make sure your stethoscope is not too cold.
– Place your stethoscope lightly on the chest wall. Ask the patient to open his or her mouth and
take a complete deep breath in and out. Listen to the sounds of the breathing and compare the
left side to the right. Listen in the upper zone, middle zone and lower zones and listen to the
front of the chest and the back.
– Normal breath sounds like wind moving in and out, while abnormal breathing sounds like air
going through water, crumpling paper bags, or no air moving at all. [See DIB]
– Respect modesty and avoid placing the stethoscope directly on the breasts when possible.
BREATHING SKILL STATION: GIVING SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN
Supplemental oxygen should be given when the patient has signs and symptoms of hypoxia – fast
breathing, anxiety, excessive sweating, cyanosis or chest pain. Where available, a pulse oximeter
should be used to measure oxygen saturation.
• If hypoxia does not appear severe, lower levels of oxygen (24–40% oxygen) can be provided to
children and adults through nasal cannula (nasal prongs), but monitor closely in case a mask is
needed. (Remember, regular air is approximately 21% oxygen)
– Nasal cannula should be about half the size of the nostril.
– Position the cannula in each nostril, making sure that it does not extend too far back or press on
the tissues.
– Secure the tubing to the cheeks or loop the tubing over the ears so that the nasal prongs and
the tubing are both on the front side of the patient’s body (never put the head through the
loop in the tubing – if patients become confused and hypoxic, they can accidentally strangle
themselves).
– Oxygen is delivered at a low rate: max 5 L/min.
• If hypoxia appears more severe (or if signs of hypoxia continue with maximum oxygen flow via
nasal cannula), a simple facemask may be used. Simple facemask is usually used with oxygen flow
rates of 6–10 L/min and can deliver approximately 40–60% oxygen.
– The facemask is applied to the face, ensuring the bridge of the nose is covered and as little as
possible leaks along the side. The mask should rest below the lower lip, but not past the chin.
The elastic strap should be placed over the head to secure the mask.
• For patients who appear extremely hypoxic or who still have signs of hypoxia with a simple
facemask, oxygen can be delivered through a non-rebreather facemask. This provides close to
100% oxygen if the reservoir bag is full.
– To prepare the non-rebreather facemask, put one finger over the valve at the top of the reservoir
bag inside the mask to inflate the bag. Then apply the non-rebreather facemask in the same way
as the simple facemask, ensuring as little leakage as possible.
– Make sure that the oxygen is attached to the wall or cannister and that the flow rate is between
10–15 L/min depending on the pressure in your oxygen system and how fast and deep the
patient breathes. If the patient is still hypoxic or the non-rebreather facemask bag does not fill,
increase the oxygen flow rate.

– NEVER put a non-rebreather facemask on before it is connected to oxygen. A true non- page 11

Assess and manage airway and provide bag-mask-ventilation (BVM) for any patient who is not
breathing or not breathing adequately (too slow for age or too shallow), any unconscious patient
with abnormal breathing (slow, shallow, gasping or noisy), or any patient with a pulse who is not
breathing (for patients without a pulse, follow relevant CPR protocols).
CAUTION! Avoid over-aggressive ventilation (using bag-valve-mask too fast or with
too much pressure) as this will damage the lungs. Children have smaller lungs that are
especially fragile. When ventilating a child, be particularly careful to only give enough
pressure to make the chest rise and be sure to allow enough time between breaths for
exhalation (for the air to escape). Large volumes of air or high pressures may result in
pneumothorax or irreversible lung damage.
Bag-mask-ventilation steps:
• If you have oxygen available, attach the BVM tubing and set the flow to the highest rate available.
DO NOT DELAY bag-mask-ventilation to prepare oxygen. (Oxygen can be attached later.)
• Place the mask over the patient’s mouth and nose (if you have two people available one person
squeezes the bag and other holds the mask on the patient’s face and keeps the airway open).
• Create a seal so that air does not leak out. Put your hand or hands in the “EC” position – your
thumb and first finger should make a “C” around the top of the mask and push down evenly, your
last three fingers should reach just under the bony part of the jaw (looking like an “E”) and pull the
jaw upward to open the airway.
– Think about pulling the face up to the mask (thus opening the airway) and pushing the mask
down onto the face (creating a seal).
– If you push down too hard without pulling the face up to the mask, you will block the airway
and the patient will be difficult to bag. If you have problems ventilating, reposition your hands
and the mask and try again.
• If the patient is breathing on his or her own, deliver breaths when the patient takes a breath
(during inspiration). Do not attempt to deliver a breath as the patient exhales.
• If you are still unable to ventilate the person after repositioning the mask, consider the possibility
of foreign body obstruction or air leak. Insert an oral or nasopharyngeal airway device if not
already in place (See SKILLS).

SKILLS
• Hold the bag in one hand and depress the bag enough to make the chest rise (to about one third
of its volume for an adult – make sure you are using the appropriate-sized bag: an adult bag
should have a volume of about 2 litres).
• Squeeze bag over 1–2 seconds to provide chest rise (giving the breath faster can cause lung
damage).
• Give one breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute) in an adult; one breath every 4 seconds
(15 breaths per minute) in older children; or one breath every 3 seconds (20 breaths per minpuatgee) 1in2
infants. CAUTION with volume of breaths given in small children (see SKILLS). Giving large volume
breaths can cause pneumothorax.
• After each breath allow the chest to fall before giving another breath.
• Watch the chest rising and falling evenly with each breath.
BVM: One provider BVM: Two providers BVM: Child
BREATHING SKILL STATION: EMERGENCY NEEDLE DECOMPRESSION
BVM: One provider BVM: Two providers BVM: Child
Needle decompression of the chest is a life-saving emergency procedure for suspected tension
pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall causing
excessive pressure on the opposite lung, the great vessels, and the heart). Patients can die very
quickly from a tension pneumothorax. These patients need an emergent chest tube, but emergency
needle decompression will relieve the immediate pressure and allow time for handover/transfer
for chest tube. Emergency needle decompression should only be performed for tension
pneumothorax.
• Expose the chest and assess breathing.
• A tension pneumothorax is identified if shock and the following are present:
– Difficulty in breathing
– Absence of lung sounds on the affected side
– Hypotension
– Distended neck veins
– Hyperresonance with percussion on the affected side
– Tracheal shift away from affected side
• Insert a large-bore (14–16G preferred) IV cannula along the upper edge of the third rib through
the second rib (intercostal) space in line with the midpoint of the clavicle on the affected side.
– In tension pneumothorax, there will be a gush of expelled air
• Give oxygen at high concentration (non-rebreather mask).
• Start IV lines and give IV fluids.
• Refer and transport to definitive care immediately.

BREATHING SKILL STATION: MANAGEMENT OF OPEN
PNEUMOTHORAX (SUCKING CHEST WOUND)
An open pneumothorax is an open chest wall wound that sucks air in when the patient breathes in.
Normally, when the chest wall is expanded, air is drawn into the lungs through the airway (through
a vacuum effect). If there is another hole in the chest wall (due to trauma) air will also be drawn in
that hole, but, rather than going into the lungs, it goes into the space between the chest wall and
lungs, creating a pneumothorax. A 3-sided dressing is placed to prevent more air from coming in
during inhalation, but to allow air from the pneumothorax to escape during exhalation to avoid
developing a tension pneumothorax. To manage a sucking chest wound (open pneumothorax):
• Give high flow oxygen.
• Cover the sucking chest wound with petroleum gauze or other non-adhesive dressing such as the
plastic wrapper from gauze packaging.
• Tape three sides of the dressing, leaving one side un-taped to act as a flap valve.
• These patients need to be transferred as soon as possible to a centre where a chest tube can be
placed. (DO NOT place a chest tube through the injury.)
Caution! There is a danger of the dressing becoming stuck to the chest wall with clotted
blood. When this happens, air cannot escape from the chest cavity and pressure can
build up, leading to a tension pneumothorax. Remove the dressing completely if there
is worsening respiratory status or evidence of worsening perfusion. If the patient
cannot be observed continuously, a three-sided dressing should NOT be placed.

SKILLS
BREATHING SKILL STATION: HOW TO MAKE A SPACER FROM A
PLASTIC BOTTLE
The purpose of a spacer is to hold the medication (salbutamol) released from a metered dose
page 14
inhaler so the person has time to effectively inhale the medication. (Without experience and proper
training, it can be difficult to use a metered dose inhaler effectively and medication is often lost into
the mouth or throat). Spacers should be made in advance, however. Do not delay salbutamol
delivery to make a spacer.
Spacer made from a plastic bottle
• Use a clean 300–500ml plastic bottle (wash with detergent and rinse and dry well).
• Take the cap off the metered dose inhaler and trace the shape of the opening of the inhaler on the
base of the bottle directly opposite the mouth of the bottle.
Spacer made from a plastic bottle
• Cut an opening into the base of the bottle slightly smaller than the traced shape. You can cut this
with scissors or a heated paper clip.
• Insert the inhaler into the spacer to check the size (the inhaler should fit tightly into the cut
opening).
• Always remember to prime the spacer with five puffs before use to clear the dead space.

3. CIRCULATION SKILL STATIONS
CIRCULATION SKILL STATION: CIRCULATION EXAM
• Check for anxiety, confusion or altered mental status.
• Feel for a pulse, assessing rate and quality (normal range is 60–100 beats per minute in adults. See
ABCDE for normal paediatric values).
• Assess capillary refill (checked by pushing on the fingernail, palms, or soles and releasing to see
how long it takes for the colour to return to the skin). The normal range is less than 3 seconds.
• Assess the skin colour and touch the skin to assess the temperature.
• Measure other vital signs: respiratory rate and blood pressure (normal adult values: RR 10–20 breaths
per minute and systolic BP greater than 90 mmHG. See ABCDE for normal paediatric values).
CIRCULATION SKILL STATION EXAM: EXTERNAL BLEEDING
CONTROL
Direct pressure for external bleeding
A wound that is deep and bleeding heavily may not stop bleeding on its own. Applying direct
pressure with a clean dressing such as gauze can help to slow or stop the bleeding (see figure).
• Put on gloves.
• Use gauze or another clean non-adherent dressing.
• Do not use bulky dressings as they can make it difficult to put enough pressure in the right place.
• Apply firm pressure as directly as possible to the source of bleeding, usually with two or three fingers.
• If the wound is on a limb, elevate the limb above the heart.
• If the first dressing becomes soaked with blood, do not remove as this will dislodge any clots that
have formed. Instead add another pad and apply firm pressure.
• When bleeding stops, apply a bandage to keep the gauze/pad in place. page 15
• If bleeding does not stop, consider deep wound packing or tourniquet (see next section).

SKILLS
Deep wound packing for external bleeding
If the wound is deep or gaping and simple pressure does not stop the bleeding, deep wound
packing may help. However, deep wound packing is a temporary procedure to stop the bleeding
since it can lead to infection if left for more than 24 hours.
• Put on gloves.
• Always assess pulses, capillary refill and sensation before and after dressing or splinting any wound.
• Thoroughly wash out the wound by flushing with at least a litre of clean water (under pressure
when possible; see next section).
• Use gauze or another clean, compact material to completely fill the space within the wound.
• Use additional gauze on top of the wound surface and apply direct pressure with your gloved
hand or a bandage wrapped firmly around the wound/limb.
• For limb wounds requiring packing, apply a splint to reduce the risk of re-bleeding.
• A deep wound pack should not be left in place for more than 24 hours because of the risk of
infection.
• If bleeding does not stop, consider tourniquet (see next section).
Tourniquet technique for uncontrolled external bleeding
You will not be expected to perform the tourniquet technique BUT you will be expected to know
what life-threatening conditions it can be used for, the special considerations around use of a
tourniquet and the ongoing care of the patient.
Use this technique ONLY if all other bleeding control measures have failed AND haemorrhage is
life-threatening. If you place a tourniquet, there is a possibility that tissues below the tourniquet
will be permanently damaged and even require amputation. If you are considering using a
tourniquet, CALL FOR HELP IMMEDIATELY and plan for handover/transfer to a unit where surgery is
possible.
• If available, use a pneumatic tourniquet (like a blood pressure cuff) over padded skin and inflate
until bleeding stops. If not, use a thick band or piece of cloth or belt (the wider, the better), over
padded skin.
• Apply as close to wound as possible, but do not place over a wound or a fracture.
• Apply enough pressure to make distal pulses disappear and re-assess bleeding.
• If bleeding stops, leave dressing in place if already present or dress the wound and prepare for
handover/transfer to a surgical care unit.
• If the bleeding does not stop, increase tourniquet pressure until major bleeding ceases.
• Record the exact time the tourniquet was applied in the notes AND write it on the patient’s skin or
the tourniquet itself.
• Consult advanced provider as soon as possible (and never more than 2 hours) after placing a
tourniquet.
• The tourniquet should be released every 2 hours for at least 10 minutes. Hold direct pressure to
the bleeding area during this time. Do not re-apply the tourniquet unless evidence of continued
active bleeding.
• Location of the tourniquet: tourniquets should only be placed on extremities and should be
placed above the level of the bleeding. Because of the relationship between the bones and blood
vessels, tourniquets on the upper arm or leg are often more effective than tourniquets placed
below the elbow or knee.
• Make sure the tourniquet is clearly visible.
• Remember tourniquet should be placed as a last resort. If you place a tourniquet, you are cutting
off blood supply to the limb, so only do this for life-threatening bleeding. When tourniquet use is
absolutely necessary, use a wide, yet constrictive, band.

• Explain to the woman what you will do and why.
• The goal is to compress the uterus between your hand and bony structures behind the uterus (e.g.
sacrum/lower back).
• Place your hand on the woman’s abdomen. Through the abdominal wall, feel for the uterus and
cup it with your hand. This will ensure it stays under your hand whilst you are massaging it. Do not
simply squeeze the uterus, but ensure that you are applying strong pressure toward the patient’s
back while massaging with a circular motion.
• Massage the uterus until it is very firm. It should feel like a 10 cm rock in the lower abdomen when
contracted.
• Do not stop massaging until the uterus is contracted (hard).
• Make sure the uterus does not become relaxed (soft) after you stop uterine massage. If it becomes
relaxed, resume massage.

CIRCULATION SKILL: IV CANNULATION
Insertion of IV cannula (adult)
Inserting an IV cannula is an essential skill required for the treatment of shock. If an adult displays
any signs and symptoms of shock, insert two large-bore cannulae (14 or 16 gauge).
• Prepare cannula, IV fluid of choice, tourniquet, gloves, dressing to cover the cannula and alcohol swab.
• Put on gloves.
• Place an elastic band or glove around the arm to function as a temporary tourniquet to help the
veins engorge (this “tourniquet” is different from the one above and should not be so tight as to
cut off arterial blood flow). Avoid placing an IV in any arm that might have a fistula for treatment
page 16
of kidney disease.
• Look and feel for a vein that is straight. Avoid blood vessels that have a pulse. If a person is in
shock, it may be difficult to find a vein. In this case search for a vein in the antecubital fossa (where
the elbow bends, see figure).
IV in antecubital fossa
• Use alcohol or other appropriate sIVki nin c alenatencsuebr ittoa lw foipssea the skin around the vein you plan to use.
• DO NOT insert an IV through skin that is broken or appears infected.
• Prepare the cannula. Preparation may vary depending on local resources and types of cannula.
• Tell the patient what you are doing.
• Remove the safety covering over the cannula (the only thing that should be inserted is the needle
with overlying plastic cannula).
• Insert the needle directly over and in line with the vein as flat and parallel to the skin as possible.
Watch for flashback (flash of blood in the cannula) when you enter the vein.
– If blood has a regular pumping pattern, you have likely hit an artery and you should remove the
needle/catheter and apply firm pressure to the site for at least 5–10 minutes.
• After seeing the flash of blood, insert the needle a few millimeters further, then advance the
plastic cannula over the needle fully into the patient’s vein. (Do NOT let the needle move forward
when you start to move the plastic cannula.)
• Hold the cannula in place, applying pressure to the base of the cannula (to occlude it and stop
the flow of blood) and withdraw the needle, leaving the cannula positioned in the vein. If needed,
withdraw blood to send for laboratory testing.
• Remove the IV tourniquet and flush the cannula with normal saline.
• Place a cap on the end of the cannula, secure the cannula well and dress the site. Document the
date the cannula was inserted in the notes.
• Ensure the needle is placed into a sharps container.
Check IV site daily for signs of infections such as skin redness, pain and swelling. Ensure the cannula
is still in the vein and not sitting in the skin next to the vein allowing fluid to be infused under the
skin creating pain and swelling. If any sign of swelling or infection, remove the IV cannula and
re-assess.

SKILLS
Insertion of IV cannula (paediatric)
Attempt to place the cannula in the hand of the child first.
Other sites that can be used to insert a cannula include:
• Scalp veins
• External jugular veins
• Antecubital veins
• Femoral veins
When preparing for IV cannulation in children ask another assistant or parent to help keep the
child’s arm still.

Veins in infants
Veins in infants
• Prepare a 21 or 23 gauge cannula.
• When inserting the cannula into the back of the hand, keep the hand bent to obstruct venous
return and make the veins visible. Place an “IV tourniquet” (as above) if needed. If you use an IV
tourniquet, be sure you don’t forget to remove it.
• Insert the cannula using the same technique used in adults. Again, be sure that the blood flows
smoothly from the catheter and is not pumping. After insertion, withdraw blood if required for
laboratory investigation. Remove the tourniquet and flush the cannula with a small amount of
normal saline after insertion.
• Secure the cannula well. Children will attempt to remove the cannula and will undo dressings.
Avoid placing a single piece of tape (plaster) that goes all the way around an extremity as this may
limit blood flow.
• If the IV is placed near a joint (hand, antecubital fossa, femoral area) splint the joint to stop it
from bending and preventing the IV fluid flowing in, and lightly bandage the IV site with bulky
dressings to prevent the child from pulling at the adhesive dressing underneath.

CIRCULATION SKILL: IV FLUID – ADJUSTING FLUID VOLUME FOR
SPECIAL CONDITIONS
Shock should be treated with IV fluids. Fluid volume must be adjusted for patients with three
conditions: malnutrition, severe anaemia and fluid overload. When administering IV fluid to any
patient, look for signs of new or worsening fluid overload: difficulty in breathing, crackles in the
lungs, increasing respiratory rate or increasing heart rate. Stop IV fluids if there are any of these
signs and plan for immediate handover to an advanced provider.
Recognizing conditions needing IV fluid adjustment in patients with shock – fluid overload,
malnutrition, and severe anaemia.
1. Is there fluid overload?
In some patients, such as those with heart or kidney failure, there may be extra fluid in the tissues
(for example, in the lungs or the soft tissues of the legs). These patients can be fluid “overloaded”
even when they have poor perfusion (because the extra fluid is not in the blood vessels). These
patients still need IV fluid if they are in shock, but IV fluid must be given more slowly with careful
monitoring so that the fluid overload does not get worse.
116677

--- Page 176 ---
SKILLS
CHECK FOR: Signs of fluid overload.
• Difficulty in breathing with crackles on chest exam
• Lower body swelling (usually in the legs)
• Unable to lie flat
• Distended neck veins
– If signs of fluid overload are present, you must adjust fluids:
 Small amount of fluids may be given (250–500 ml boluses in adults).
 Slow the rate of fluid administration.
 Monitor closely for worsening signs of fluid overload (increasing respiratory rate or heart rate,
new or worsening difficulty breathing and increasing crackles in the chest).
 Stop IV fluids if any of these signs develop.
 REMEMBER: It is important to go slowly so you can stop for early signs of fluid overload. If
you don’t stop IV fluid when these early signs develop, too much IV fluid can cause a patient’s
lungs to fill with fluid and create severe difficulty in breathing, or even death.
2. Does the patient have severe anaemia?
In patients with severe anaemia, IV fluid can dilute the blood and lower its capacity to carry oxygen
to dangerous levels. Additionally, patients with severe anaemia tend to show signs of fluid overload
more quickly with IV fluid administration. Remember: you should only give IV fluids to someone
with severe anaemia if there are signs of shock (see figure).
CHECK FOR: Signs of severe anaemia.
• Severe pallor to the palms of the hands (compare to your own palm) or the mucous membranes.
• Fast breathing or fast heart rate
• Confusion or restlessness
• May also have signs of heart failure/fluid overload
• If these signs of severe anaemia are present, you must adjust fluids:
 Slow the rate of fluid administration.
 Monitor closely and stop IV fluids for worsening.
 Rapid handover/transfer to a centre capable of blood transfusion.
3. Is the patient severely malnourished?
• IV fluid can cause life-threatening swelling and heart failure in malnourished patients and must be
adjusted very carefully. Malnourished patients are also at very high risk of hypoglycaemia.

CHECK FOR: Signs of malnourishment.
• Visible wasting: a child with severe wasting does not look just thin, but is visibly bony with skin
that appears too large for the body. The arms, legs and buttocks may be thin, and the head may
appear relatively large because of wasting of the body.
• Oedema of both feet: take shoes or socks off and assess both feet for oedema. Press the top of the
foot gently with your thumb for a few seconds to see if a dent remains in the tissues. Remember
that a severely malnourished child may not appear very thin if there is a lot of oedema.
– If these signs of severe malnutrition are present, you must adjust fluids. [See FLUID
ADMINISTRATION IN SHOCK (CHILD WITH SEVERE MALNUTRITION) for detailed fluid choice and
administration rates]
 Oral fluid is preferred if the patient can tolerate it.
 Add dextrose: use dextrose-containing fluids or give a dose of dextrose with IV fluids.
 Slow the rate of fluid administration.
 Monitor closely and stop IV fluids for any signs of fluid overload.
 Switch to oral fluid as soon as possible.

SKILLS
CIRCULATION SKILL: IV FLUID – ADMINISTRATION
Fluid administration for shock in adults
• Attach normal saline or Lactated Ringer’s solution to the cannula.
• In adults give 1 litre over less than 30 minutes.
• Assess response to fluid immediately after the fluid bolus. Assess perfusion (capillary refill, mental
status, urine output), and check for pulse rate and blood pressure. If improving, the pulse rate
should lower and the blood pressure should increase. Mental status may also improve.
• Assess for fluid overload (see signs above).
• If still in shock with no evidence of fluid overload, give another 1 litre bolus.
• If still in shock after 2 litres of IV fluid, re-assess for ongoing blood loss (external and internal) or
spinal injury, and call for advanced provider.
If there is evidence of severe malnutrition, severe anaemia or fluid overload:
• Patients with shock still need IV fluids, but it is important to re-assess frequently for signs of
worsening overload.
– For these adult patients who are at high risk for fluid overload, bolus with 500 ml IV fluid initially,
then re-assess. If no signs of fluid overload or fluid in the lungs, give additional 500 ml.
Fluid administration for shock in children
The appropriate amount of fluid for critically ill children is controversial given recent evidence that
bolus fluids can worsen outcomes in some children. In addition, relevant criteria for poor perfusion
and shock may vary by context. The 2016 WHO guidelines for the care of critically ill children (see
WHO Sources section) use the presence of three clinical features to define shock requiring bolus
fluids: cold extremities, capillary refill greater than 3 seconds, and weak and fast pulse.
For children with poor perfusion that is due to loss of fluid, such as those with bleeding, burns or
severe diarrhoea/vomiting, bolus fluids are also recommended.
For other children with evidence of poor perfusion, smaller amounts of fluids given more slowly
may be safer.
Country teams should consider the clinical presentation of the child, the capacity of providers to
detect signs of fluid overload, and the availability of monitoring and support equipment when
adapting recommendations to the national context.
To give IV fluid resuscitation to a child in shock WITHOUT severe malnutrition, severe anaemia or
overload:
• Insert IV cannula as described above.
• Weigh the child or ask the parents for a recent weight.
• Give normal saline or Lactated Ringer’s: 10–20 ml per kilogram of body weight over 30 minutes.
Re-assess the child after the first infusion.
• If no improvement, repeat 10 ml per kilogram of body weight over 30 minutes.
Call for help and plan to handover to an advanced provider and unit with the capacity for blood

IV fluid resuscitation for a child in shock WITH severe malnutrition
Children that are in shock AND have severe malnutrition require specialized fluids (if available)
with different rates of infusion. Children with severe malnutrition and shock are at very high risk of
hypoglycaemia and will need sugar in addition to fluids. [See MEDICATIONS] If the child can take
oral fluids, give oral rehydration with ReSoMal (unless the child is in shock due to cholera, then use
ORS). If the child is lethargic, unconscious or not capable of taking oral fluids, then give IV fluids.
CAUTION! Intravenous fluid administration can be dangerous in malnourished children. While
giving fluid in any way, you must check every 5 minutes for the following danger signs: new or
worsening DIB, respiratory rate increase of >5 per minute or heart rate increase of >15 beats per
minute. Stop fluids if any danger sign develops.

• Insert IV line as above.
• Weigh the child.
• Give 10–15 ml per kilogram of IV fluid over 1 hour. If specialized fluids are available, give one of the
following according to availability:
– Ringer’s Lactate with 5% glucose (dextrose)
– Half-strength Darrow’s solution with 5% glucose (dextrose)
– 0.45% normal saline with 5% glucose (dextrose).
• If you do not have dextrose-containing fluids, then give one of the following:
– Ringer’s Lactate AND give a separate oral or IV dose of dextrose [See MEDICATIONS]
– Normal saline AND give a separate oral or IV dose of dextrose. [See MEDICATIONS]
Re-assess the child after the first 5–10 minutes of the infusion and then every 5 minutes:
If the child worsens during rehydration (increased difficulty in breathing, breathing rate increases
by 5/min and pulse rate increases by 15/min or lung crackles develop):
• Stop the fluids.
• Call for help and plan for handover to an advanced provider.
If there is no improvement after the first infusion:
• Call for help. Plan for handover to an advanced provider at a centre with blood transfusion capabilities.
• Give fluid at 4 ml per kilogram over 1 hour while awaiting transfer to the advanced provider.
If the child displays signs of improvement (improved capillary refill, lower pulse rate and respiratory rate):
• Switch to oral or nasogastric rehydration with ReSoMal (low sodium oral rehydration solution) 10
ml per kilogram per hour for up to 10 hours.
• Transfer to a malnutrition unit.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Children with severe anaemia and poor perfusion need urgent handover to an advanced provider
and unit with the capacity for blood transfusion.
Children who need IV fluids, but in whom bolus fluids are not indicated should be given
maintenance fluids.
See the WHO Child Health publications page (www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/

The AVPU scale is a simplified assessment that can give you an indication of level of consciousness
by assessing response to stimuli. The AVPU scale is particularly useful for children and infants.
• A= Alert. People who are fully awake and interactive (even if not fully oriented) are alert.
• V= Voice. Those who are not fully alert before stimulus (may have eyes closed or appear sleepy), but
do respond to voice without being touched (the response may be words, moaning or movement).
• P= Pain. Those who do not respond to voice, but do respond to pain: hard chest (sternal) rub in
adults, pinch to the sole of the foot in children, or pinch to bridge of nose in suspected spinal
injury. The response may be words, moaning or movement.
• U= Unresponsive. Those who do not make any movement or verbal response to painful stimuli
are unresponsive.
• For any patient who is P or U on the AVPU scale, stop and return to the ABCDE as rapid
intervention may be needed to protect the airway.

5. IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATIONS
Approach to spinal immobilization
There are two types of spinal immobilization: cervical spine and thoracic/lumbar spine. Together,
these are called full spine immobilization. Immobilization stabilizes the bones to avoid further
injury to the spine. Provide spinal immobilization to any person with a history of polytrauma
who is unconscious; or who is conscious and has neck pain, spine tenderness, numbness or
weakness. Remember, immobilized patients cannot move normally and are at a higher risk of
airway blockage (by secretions or vomit) and pressure sore development. Monitor closely.
IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: CERVICAL SPINE IMMOBILIZATION
To immobilize the cervical spine:
• Keep the patient flat on his or her back and face up on a level surface such as a bed.
• Tell the patient what you are doing.
• Hold the patient’s head in line with the spine with two hands on either side of the head.
• Prevent the patient’s neck from moving with locally available materials (towel rolls, newspaper,
sandbags, or bags of IV fluids) or cervical collar if available. These can be secured to the head with
tape (plaster) but should never be secured to the bed. (If the patient vomits, you will not be able
to turn him or her and if the patient falls, the tape (plaster) could cause a cervical spine injury.)
• If the patient vomits, use the log-roll technique (see below) to turn the whole patient onto his or
her side, keeping the head in line with the body.
• Keep someone with the patient at all times to watch the airway.
• Remember, a patient who has severe pain/injury elsewhere may not be able to feel neck pain,
even if there is a fracture. A concerning mechanism should raise suspicion.
117799

--- Page 188 ---
SKILLS
IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: LOG ROLL
To move any immobilized patient or anyone with a suspected spine injury (e.g. if the patient has to
vomit or needs to be transferred), use the log-roll technique (see figure):
• Ask for assistance. Ideally, have one person at the head to hold the neck, one or two people to
hold the body and one for the legs.
• The provider at the head must keep the head, neck and torso aligned with the rest of the spine.
The provider should place their forearms tightly alongside the head with hands gripping the
shoulders to keep the head and neck in line with the rest of the spine. Keep this alignment when
turning the patient.
• The person controlling the head and neck leads the team and will say, “1–2-3 roll” to guide timing
of the roll for all assistants.
• Working together, roll the patient onto his or her side, keeping the spine in line.
• During the roll, the person providing head and neck control must ensure the cervical spine page 24
remains aligned with the rest of the spine. The people rolling the body should also ensure that the
rest of the spine stays in as straight a line as possible.
• When the patient is turned onto one side, a provider can examine the back, place or remove a
backboard and/or manage back wounds as needed.
• To lie the patient flat again, the person controlling the head and neck uses the “1–2–3 roll”
command to ensure coordinated movement.
• Always remove a backboard as soon as possible using the log-roll technique. Time on a backboard
increases the risk of pressure sores. Check pressure areas frequently using the log roll.

IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: FULL SPINAL IMMOBILIZATION
To immobilize the thoracic and lumbar spine (see previous section for cervical spine immobilization):
• Immobilize the cervical spine as in previous section.
• Keep the person on a flat surface with instructions to lie flat and not to move.
• For transport, log roll the patient onto a flat surface (such as a backboard) to prevent movement of
the spine. Do not attach the backboard to the bed, as you will be unable to log roll (see above) if
needed.
page 25
• Before immobilizing, be sure there is no glass or debris on or under the patient’s back. Use the log
roll to check. Immobilized patients must be checked regularly to avoid pressure point wounds.
• If the person needs to vomit, use the log-roll technique to roll the person to the side so that no
vomit enters the airway.
• Spine boards should ONLY be used to move patients. Leaving patients on spine boards for long
periods of time can cause pressure sores. Remove patients from boards as soon as they arrive at
the facility and can be laid flat.
Spinal immobilization for moving a patient
IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: POSITIONING OF THE PREGNANT
PATIENT
• If a patient is over 20 weeks pregnant and needs spinal immobilization, immobilize the spine as
Spinal immobilization for moving a patient
above. Then place padding under the side of the board near the back and hips to tilt the patient
onto her left side. This helps to prevent compression of the large internal blood vessels by the
pregnant uterus which could decrease blood returning to the heart.

SKILLS
IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: RECOVERY POSITION
• If the patient is unconscious or semiconscious and if there is NO TRAUMA, place the patient on page 26
his or her left side. Stabilize the patient by bending the top leg forward. The left arm should be
straight with the patient’s head resting on the arm to elevate the head and position the mouth
downward. This position will allow for vomit and other secretions to drain from the mouth with
less risk of airway obstruction. This is called the recovery position (see figure).

IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: FRACTURE IMMOBILIZATION
FRACTURE IMMOBILIZATION
Splints are used for immobilizing suspected fractured limbs, preventing pain caused by movement
of broken bones and minimizing further bleeding and damage. Always assess and record perfusion
of the limb beyond the fracture by assessing pulses and capillary refill time. Always assess pulses,
capillary refill and sensation before AND after dressing or splinting any wound.
• If no perfusion (limb cold, pale, no pulse, slow or no capillary refill), rapid re-alignment (reduction)
of the limb is required to restore circulation.
• If there is still no perfusion after re-alignment of the limb, splint and plan for rapid handover/
transfer to a specialist unit.
• If you cannot re-align the limb, rapidly handover/transfer to an advanced provider.
Goal of fracture management:
• Restore circulation
• Treat and reduce pain
• Prevent further injury and bleeding
• Re-align bony fragments so that healing and union can take place and normal function is restored
Splinting materials include:
• Padding to protect the skin and allow swelling
• Pre-formed splint for base or modified local resources
• Bandages to secure the splint
• Adhesive tape (plaster)
Before applying a splint, tell the person what you are doing and give pain relief.
• Remove clothing to clearly see the injury.
• Remove all jewelry.
• Check pulses, capillary refill, sensation and movement of the limb. Document this before and after
application of the splint.
• Size the splint to immobilize the joint above and below the fracture site.
• If the limb is visibly deformed and pulses beyond the fracture are weak or absent, first straighten
(reduce) the fracture prior to applying the splint. Do not force realignment of a deformed limb if
the limb has a good pulse.
• Place the joint in the desired position and if the injury involves fingers or toes, pad between toes
and fingers.
• If stocking gauze is available, place it over the limb without wrinkles to avoid skin damage.
• Pad the side of the splint that will be in contact with the skin, and pad the limb, especially bony
protrusions (like the elbow).
• Wrap the limb and splint with a bandage to hold the splint. Ask the patient how it feels to ensure
it is not too tight. The splint should be secure, but remember that the limb will swell, so it is
important that the splint and bandaging are not too tight.
• Check pulses, sensation and movement of the limb following the application of the splint and
every hour afterward.
118833

--- Page 192 ---
SKILLS
FRACTURE IMMOBILIZATION: OPEN
Consider an open fracture if there is a wound near a fracture site. Open fracture sites can often be
contaminated and will require cleaning and potentially surgical debridement before the fracture
can be fixed. If an open fracture is suspected, plan for handover/transfer to a surgical or orthopaedic
unit after splinting.
• Give pain relief prior to splinting.
• Control haemorrhage with direct pressure. In limb amputation, if bleeding is uncontrolled apply
tourniquet (see above), commence fluid resuscitation and plan for rapid handover/transfer.
• Straighten (reduce) the limb if there are signs of poor perfusion or absent pulses in the limb.
• Remove any dirt, grass, obvious glass or other debris from the wound and irrigate the wound with
2 litres of normal saline.
• Cover the wound with saline-soaked gauze.
• Splint as above, but leave a window so you can continue to monitor the wound.
• In amputation, cover wound with sterile, saline-soaked gauze or towel.
• Give tetanus vaccination.
• Begin IV antibiotics.
IMMOBILIZATION SKILL STATION: APPLYING A PELVIC BINDER
Pelvic fractures can cause life-threatening haemorrhage by damaging blood vessels adjacent to
the fractures. If a person has been injured and has pain in and around the pelvis, apply a binder
(see figures). As the pelvis is shaped in a ring, the binder will bring together the displaced bones
and help limit internal bleeding. Signs of pelvic fractures include pain or abnormal movement of
the pelvis on exam; bruising around the hips, at the top of legs, or to the genitals; and signs and
symptoms of shock.
• Place bed sheet or similar under the pelvis. If the bed sheet is wide, fold it over so that it spans
from the lower back to the end of the buttocks.
• You may need to log roll the patient in order to get the binder in position.
• The sheet should be centered over the greater trochanters (hip bones, as demonstrated by the
instructor) and firmly cross-over at the front. page 27
• Pull firmly and tie, but do not cause the person undue pain. It should feel firm but not overly painful.
• Document what time the pelvic binder was applied.
• Check the binder each hour. Confirm that the binder is still applying pressure around the pelvis.
Ensure that that skin is intact where the binder has been applied and around the genitals.

– Thoroughly wash out wound by flushing with at least 1 litre of clean water.
 The water should be under pressure to thoroughly clean the wound. To create a high pressure
stream, use a syringe (with 14 g needle or IV catheter attached) or poke a small hole in a clean
bottle and squeeze the bottle.
 Be sure to use the entire litre.
– If not vaccinated or not up to date, give tetanus vaccination.
• Dressing wounds:
– Dress wound with sterile gauze if available.
– Use a pressure dressing if the wound is still bleeding.
– Check perfusion (capillary refill and/or distal pulses) and sensation beyond the wound before
AND after dressing wounds.
• Pain management:
– Give local anaesthetic before cleaning the wound if staff and equipment are available.
– Splint large lacerations and fractures.
WOUND MANAGEMENT: BURN MANAGEMENT
It is important to cover burns early in order to keep the area moist and reduce the risk of infection.
Burns can be very painful so ensure you give pain relief.
• Use sterile technique and normal saline to clean the burn.
• Carefully remove any loose, dead skin and broken, tense or infected blisters.
• Apply a non-adherent dressing to the burn to provide a moist healing environment. Clean clear
plastic wrap can be used over the burn as an interim measure and if you are transferring the
person to a surgical unit shortly.
• Ensure the entire burn is covered with the dressing.
• If the person has presented with an old burn that is now infected, apply a topical antibiotic (such
as bacitracin or silver sulfadiazine). This person may also require IV or intramuscular antibiotics.
• If there is delay in handover or transfer, ensure the dressings are changed daily. Always give pain
control with dressing changes.

ADULT BURN MANAGEMENT: DETERMINE TOTAL BODY SURFACE AREA (TBSA)
This is used to calculate the fluids needed using the Parkland Formula. Use the Rule of Nines body
chart for adults and modified chart for children and infants (see figure).
The body is divided into portions that each make up 9% of the total body surface. Children have
different percentages due to the different body proportions, such as a larger head and smaller limbs
(see figures).
• Assess the person using the diagram below.
• Note the areas of burn and shade them in on the diagram.
• Next to where you are shading, write the burn depth (see burn depth estimate below).
• Once you have marked the diagram (front and back) with all the burns you have assessed on the
person, add the percentages.
• This will give you the total burn surface area (TBSA).

BURN MANAGEMENT: ESTIMATE DEPTH OF BURN
The best way to estimate burn depth is by gently pressing two fingers onto the burn to assess
capillary refill.
• Put gloves on.
• With care, press down on the centre of the burn with two fingertips for 3–4 seconds, and then let
go. The faster the capillary refill the more superficial the burn is.
• Now assess the outer edge of the burn (burn depth can vary for different areas of the burn).
• Use the chart below to guide your assessment findings.

BURN MANAGEMENT: FLUID RESUSCITATION IN BURN INJURY
As discussed in the TRAUMA module, an adult or child with a burn injury may require fluid
resuscitation. Start fluid resuscitation in the following cases:
• Full or partial thickness burns greater than or equal to 15% total burn surface area in adults.
• Full or partial thickness burns greater than or equal to 10% total burn surface area in children.
BURN MANAGEMENT: PARKLAND FORMULA CALCULATION FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS
4 ml IV fluid X weight in kilograms X % total burn surface area*
*% total burn surface area = % partial thickness burn area + % full thickness burn area
(% superficial burn area is NOT used in the calculation)
The Parkland Formula is a fluid resuscitation management strategy for the initial 24 hours following
a burn. Patients presenting beyond 24 hours after the initial burn will also need fluid resuscitation,
but the Parkland Formula is not used beyond 24 hours.
• The first half of the fluid should be given within the first 8 hours after the burn (NOT after arrival to
care).
• The second half is to be given over the subsequent 16 hours.
• For adults, give normal saline or Ringer’s Lactate.
• For children, use a dextrose-containing fluid (Ringer’s Lactate with 5% dextrose or normal saline
with 5% dextrose for initial resuscitation). If no dextrose-containing fluids are available, give an
additional dose of dextrose (either IV or orally) with IV fluids (see MEDICATIONS).
For ongoing care of children, the Parkland emergency resuscitation fluids calculated above MUST
BE ADDED to any required maintenance fluids based on hospital care protocols (see WHO Pocket
book of hospital care for children, 2013).
Your facilitator will review examples using the Parkland Formula.
REMEMBER: Patients with serious burns to >15% of their body, burns involving the hand, face, groin
area, joints, or burns that go completely around the body or a body part need to be transferred/
handed over for specialized care.

WOUND MANAGEMENT: SNAKE BITE BANDAGING AND
IMMOBILIZATION
Note: When possible, take a picture of the snake and send with the patient.
Immobilizing a limb after a snake bite is important to reduce movement and absorption of venom.
• Always assess pulses, capillary refill and sensation before and after dressing or splinting any wound.
• You may choose to use a broad pressure bandage and wrap upwards from the lower portion
of the bite. The bandage should be firm, but should not cut off pulses in the limb. Extend the
bandage as high up the limb as possible.
– This is recommended if the snakes in your area produce a toxin that damages the nerves, causes
paralysis, causes the person to become very ill or if there will be prolonged transport time.
– This is NOT recommended if the snakes in your area produce toxins that primarily cause tissue
damage near the wound and do not cause body-wide symptoms.
• Bind a splint to the limb to immobilize as much of the limb as possible.
• Note the time the bandage was placed.
• Keep the person still and lying down.
• DO NOT put a tourniquet around the snake bite or limb.
• DO NOT cut the bite out as this will lead to unnecessary bleeding.
• DO NOT suck on the bite to remove the venom.

The table below summarizes the medications discussed in this course, which represent only
a very basic set of treatments for emergency conditions. They have been included based on
their wide availability, their appropriateness for use by all of the frontline providers targeted
by this course, their feasibility of use in pre-hospital or facility settings, and for their potential
importance as early treatments for emergency conditions. Be sure to check locally available
drug concentrations, as these can vary. The most common concentrations are used in this
table for dosing reference. Almost every condition discussed will require additional treatments
beyond these, and many important emergency treatments that may be used by advanced
providers are not included here.

8. Transfer and handover skills discussion
This course is intended for providers working in the field, on ambulances and in health-care
facilities. Transferring patients from the scene to first facility, or between facilities, require
special attention to destination planning, ongoing management and handover.
DESTINATION PLANNING
Many patients treated on the scene will require transport to a health-care facility for further
management. Additionally, patients already at a facility may require transfer to a different
facility for more advanced care. For example, a pregnant woman with seizures will need
handover for advanced care and emergency delivery; a patient with severe burns will require
transfer for advanced airway management and surgical care; a patient in shock from blood loss
will require handover to a centre capable of blood transfusion.
When planning any transport, make sure that: the level of services at the destination facility
matches the needs of the patient (e.g. there is an operating theatre if surgery is needed); that
the expected resources are currently available (e.g., the operating theatre is running, and there
is blood for transfusion); and that the destination can be reached in the necessary time frame
given the patient’s condition. Do not delay transport for tests or interventions that are not
critical to patient safety if they can be performed at the receiving facility.
Follow local transfer and destination protocols where they exist. Where there are no clear
protocols, balance transport times with facility capabilities – the goal is to reach needed care
as soon as possible. It is usually better to have a longer initial transport time than to arrange a
second transfer because appropriate care was not available at the first destination.
Once the appropriate facility has been determined, communication with a provider at
the receiving facility is essential (see ‘Handover’ below). This will allow the receiving centre
to prepare for the patient’s arrival and arrange resources (e.g. blood, operating theatre
preparation). Follow specific local communication protocols where they exist.
Wherever possible, formal protocols for both pre-hospital transport and transfer between
facilities should be in place. These should include explicit criteria for when a patient should be
transferred.
TRANSPORT
Transfer includes two aspects: transporting the patient and caring for the patient at all times
during transport. One person cannot do both jobs. During transport, at least one provider
should always be in the same part of the vehicle as the patient to allow for ongoing monitoring,
assessment and management. The ABCDE approach should be used to assess and re-assess
ALL patients during transportation; vital signs (including AVPU or GCS) should be checked
every 15 minutes, and patients should be closely monitored for response to treatments and
for signs of worsening.
Remember to plan overall transportation time and route, and check road conditions and
weather. This is essential in order to anticipate the patient’s needs during transport (e.g. IV
fluid and medication needs). Ensure that the patient and family are aware of the transport plan.
Allow a family member to accompany children whenever possible.
119999

--- Page 208 ---
SKILLS
HANDOVER
Formal handover should be given any time care is transferred to a new provider, including:
between providers within a facility, to or from transport providers, or remotely from a sending
facility to a receiving facility provider. In addition to a verbal report at the time a patient is
handed over to a new provider, written documentation of the clinical condition and treatment
should accompany the patient at all times.
You will practise handover summaries throughout the course in the case scenarios. The
Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations (SBAR) format is a structured way of
communicating key information and can be used for all of the handovers mentioned above.
SBAR components and examples are:
SITUATION
 Basic patient information (e.g. age, sex).
 Chief complaint (the patient’s initial description of the problem, such as difficulty in
breathing for 3 days, or arm pain after a fall, etc.).
BACKGROUND
 The 2–4 most important and relevant aspects of the patient’s case and/or condition (these
may be elements of the history, physical exam, or testing results, depending on the case).
 Include any important ABCDE findings/interventions.
ASSESSMENT
 What you think is wrong with the patient.
 The reason for the handover/transfer.
RECOMMENDATIONS
 Specific things the new provider should prepare for:
– next steps in the treatment plan;
– potential worsening of the patient’s condition (e.g. need for close airway observation if
inhalation burn is suspected);
– cautions regarding prior therapies or interventions (e.g. time of last adrenaline dose to
anticipate return symptoms, need to monitor mental status if sedating medications have
been given, need to monitor 3-way dressing for clotting, etc.).
Examples:
Case 1: A 22 year-old man was riding a motorcycle when he crashed into another vehicle at
high speed. He was thrown from his motorcycle and was not wearing a helmet. His airway is
open; he has normal breath sounds on both sides of his chest; his pulses are strong and around
90 beats per minute; he is only responsive to pain and has a femur fracture with bone visible in
an open wound; there are abrasions on his forehead. You have immobilized his spine, started
an IV and splinted the fracture. You and your colleague have transported him from the scene
of injury and are handing him over to a hospital provider.

Handover summary: This is a 22-year-old man who was in a motorcycle crash, was not wearing a
helmet and was thrown from his motorcycle; he is only responsive to pain and has an open femur
fracture, but is currently protecting his airway and has no evidence of shock. We are concerned
for his altered mental status, and open femur fracture, but are unable to tell if he has a spinal
injury. He needs transfer for surgical management and further neurological assessment. Spinal
immobilization should be maintained and he should be monitored for worsening bleeding and
mental status changes.
Case 2: A 14-year-old girl had a seizure/convulsion at school. She was brought to you by her
teachers because she did not stop seizing. You administered a benzodiazepine, which caused
the seizures to stop. After, you were able to perform the ABCDE survey and then a complete
head-to-toe exam. She does not have a fever; she has a normal heart rate, blood pressure, and
respiratory rate. She responds to voice. Her tongue is bitten and she urinated on herself; she
has no other injuries or rashes.
Handover summary: This is a 14-year-old girl who had a prolonged convulsion and was convulsing
on arrival; her seizures were stopped with one 10 mg dose of diazepam and now she remains sleepy,
has normal vital signs and no fever. She is being transferred for further evaluation of her seizure.
Monitor the airway as she has received sedating medications (diazepam).
Case 3: A 75-year-old man had chest pain while walking home from the market. He was brought
to you by taxi. He says that the chest pain started 30 minutes ago and felt like a lot of pressure
in the centre of his chest. He has no allergies. He takes a blood pressure medication, but cannot
recall the medication’s name. He had a heart attack 2 years ago that felt very much like the pain
he was having today. His last meal was 6 hours ago. The pain started while he was walking
home carrying several heavy bags, though he now has no pain. His vital signs, ABCDE survey,
and head-to-toe examination are normal. You have given aspirin and started an IV line and will
now handover to an inpatient provider.
Handover summary: This is a 75-year-old man with a history of a heart attack who has had chest
pain similar to his prior heart attack. The pain started while he was walking and lasted for more
than 30 minutes, but is now gone. He has received aspirin and has an IV line. I am concerned he
might have problems with his heart. He should be monitored for change in ABCDE or return of the
chest pain.

Altered mental status (AMS)
Term used for a range of presentations from changes in behaviour or memory, to disorientation,
confusion and coma.
AMS
See altered mental status.
Anaemia
Decreased concentration of red blood cells, leading to a decreased ability to carry oxygen.
Anaphylaxis
A severe allergic reaction that can cause shock.
Asthma
A condition causing mucus production and intermittent spasm in the bronchial airways,
resulting in narrowing that causes wheezing.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN
THE FOLLOWING ARE DANGER SIGNS IN CHILDREN WITH BREATHING COMPLAINTS:
• Fast breathing • Poor feeding or drinking, or vomits everything
• Increased breathing eff ort (chest indrawing/retractions) • Seizures/convulsions, current or recent
• Cyanosis • Drooling or stridor when calm
• Altered mental status (including lethargy) • Hypothermia
Wheezing in children is often caused by an object inhaled into the airway, viral infection or asthma.
Stridor in children is often caused by an object stuck in the airway or airway swelling from infection.
Fast or deep breathing can indicate diabetic crisis (DKA), which may be the fi rst sign of diabetes in a child.
FAST BREATHING MAY BE THE ONLY SIGN OF A SERIOUS BREATHING PROBLEM IN A CHILD.
DISPOSITION
Salbutamol and IM adrenaline eff ects last for about 3 hours, and life-threatening symptoms may recur. Monitor closely, always
have repeat dose available during transport and caution new providers at handover.
Naloxone lasts approximately 1 hour, and most opioids last longer. Monitor closely, always have repeat dose available during
transport and caution new providers.
Following immersion in water (drowning), a person may develop delayed breathing problems after several hours. Monitor
closely and caution new providers.
Never leave patients with diffi culty in breathing unmonitored during handover/transfer.
Make transfer arrangements as early as possible for any patient who may require intubation or assisted ventilation.

PAEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS
ALWAYS consider unwitnessed toxic ingestion Ask about any medications in the household, and any chemicals (eg cleaning
products, antifreeze) in or near the house.
Check and regularly re-check blood glucose Low blood glucose is common in ill young children.
High blood glucose can present with AMS and dehydration.
AVOID hypothermia Keep skin-to-skin with mother, cover child’s head. Uncover only the parts you
need to see, one at a time, during exam.
Danger signs with ingestions Monitor closely and arrange handover/transfer for advanced airway
management.
• Stridor
• Oral chemical burns
Monitor fl uid status closely Paediatric patients are more susceptible to both fl uid losses and fl uid overload.
DISPOSITION CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with AMS who may not be able to protect the airway should never be left alone. Monitor closely and give direct
handover to new provider.
Naloxone lasts approximately 1 hour. Most opioids last longer-- always alert new providers that patients may need repeat doses.
Hypoglycaemia often recurs. Alert new providers to monitor blood glucose frequently in any patient who has been treated
for hypoglycaemia.

Patient positioning
• Position patient for best airway opening and breathing.
• Use recovery position if no trauma.
• If >20 weeks pregnant and NO spine injury: Place pillows along the length of her right back to tilt patient onto her left side.
This avoids compression of the large blood vessels by the pregnant uterus.
• Check that cervical spine has been immobilized if indicated.
• Possible spine injury: use backboard and log-roll manoeuvre to move patients. Check for pressure spots every 2 hours; pad
areas with soft material as needed. If >20-weeks pregnant: Tip backboard slightly to the left using a wedge or other materials.
• Splint or immobilize fractures to protect soft tissues and decrease pain and bleeding.
On-going care during transport
• Re-assess the ABCDE approach at least every 15 minutes, including repeat vital signs and glucose checks if patient has been
hypoglycaemic
• Control bleeding prior to transport and monitor site for new bleeding
• Perform regular re-assessment of any splinted extremity
• Continue necessary treatments (e.g. oxygen, IV fl uids, oxytocin, glucose)
• Keep the patient from getting too hot or too cold during transport.
229

--- Page 238 ---
Paediatric Considerations
• Prepare appropriate size equipment and weight-adjusted dosages of critical medications.
• Bring a family member or friend, and tell the receiving facility who is accompanying the child.
• Remember that critically ill or injured children can look well initially and then worsen quickly. Monitor closely.
• Hypothermia and hypoglycaemia are common in children. Monitor closely.
SBAR handover
• Situation: Basic patient information (e.g. age, sex); chief complaint (the patient’s initial description of the problem, such as
diffi culty in breathing for 3 days, or arm pain after a fall)
• Background: 2–4 most important and relevant aspects of patient’s case and/or condition; important ABCDE fi ndings/
interventions.
• Assessment: What you think is wrong with the patient; reason for the handover/transfer.
• Recommendations: next steps in treatment plan; potential worsening of the patient’s condition (e.g. need for close airway
observation if inhalation burn is suspected); cautions regarding prior therapies or interventions (e.g. time of last adrenaline
dose to anticipate return symptoms, need to monitor mental status if sedating medications have been given, need to
monitor 3-way dressing for clotting, etc.).
