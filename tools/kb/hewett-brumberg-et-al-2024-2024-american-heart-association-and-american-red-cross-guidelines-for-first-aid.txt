AHA/AMERICAN RED CROSS GUIDELINE
2024 American Heart Association and American
Red Cross Guidelines for First Aid

ABSTRACT: Codeveloped by the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, these guidelines represent the
first comprehensive update of first aid treatment recommendations since 2010. Incorporating the results of structured
evidence reviews from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, these guidelines cover first aid treatment for
critical and common medical, traumatic, environmental, and toxicological conditions. This update emphasizes the continuous
evolution of evidence evaluation and the necessity of adapting educational strategies to local needs and diverse community
demographics. Existing guidelines remain relevant unless specifically updated in this publication. Key topics that are new, are
substantially revised, or have significant new literature include opioid overdose, bleeding control, open chest wounds, spinal
motion restriction, hypothermia, frostbite, presyncope, anaphylaxis, snakebite, oxygen administration, and the use of pulse
oximetry in first aid, with the inclusion of pediatric-specific guidance as warranted.

MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
Bronchodilators for Asthma With Shortness of
Breath
Background
There are many causes of shortness of breath. First aid
providers may encounter a person with a previous diag-
nosis of asthma who has acute difficulty breathing or is
wheezing. Many will carry prescribed inhaled medication
with them to use when they are experiencing an asth-
ma exacerbation. Some people, because of severity of
illness or other factors, may require assistance to self-
administer bronchodilator medication.
The ILCOR performed a scoping review on potential
harms from bronchodilator administration in 2022.1 An
updated literature search was performed by the writing
